<p>“Stereotyped,” said Martin Gray. “That’s the
word!” He spoke triumphantly, as one will
when a moment’s search for the proper term
has been rewarded. “Stereotyped, Clem!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” replied his room-mate,
only mildly interested in Mart’s subject. “Of
course they do look pretty much alike—”</p>

<p>“It isn’t only their looks, though. But, come
to think of it, that’s another proof of my—er—contention.
Hang it, Clem, if they weren’t all
alike as so many—er—beans—”</p>

<p>“Don’t you mean peas?” asked Clement Harland,
grinning.</p>

<p>“Beans,” continued Mart emphatically. “They
wouldn’t all wear the same things, would they?”</p>

<p>“Don’t see that, Mart. After all, a chap’s
simply got to follow the jolly old style, eh?”</p>

<p>“Not if he has any—er—individuality! No,
sir! I saw fifty at least of the new class arrive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
yesterday, and except that sometimes one was
shorter or taller or fatter than the others, you
could have sworn they were all from the same
town. Yes, sir, and the same street! Same
clothes, same hats, same shoes, same—”</p>

<p>“Well, after all, why not? Besides, after
they’ve been here awhile they develop different—as
you’d say—‘er—characteristics.’ What if the
kids do look alike when they first come?”</p>

<p>“But you don’t get the—er—the idea at all!”
protested Martin. “What I’m trying to get
at—”</p>

<p>“Is that Alton Academy attracts a certain type
of fellow and doesn’t get enough freaks to suit
you.”</p>

<p>“Freaks be blowed! I don’t want freaks, I
want new blood, something different now and
then. You know as well as I do that new blood
is what—”</p>

<p>“You’ve got the ‘melting pot’ idea, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess so. Why not? Look at the other
schools; some of ’em, anyway: Dexter, Dover—”</p>

<p>“Croton?”</p>

<p>“I said some of ’em. Take Dexter now.”</p>

<p>“I refuse.”</p>

<p>“Look at the—er—variety of fellows that go
there. What’s the result?”</p>

<p>“Why, the result is that they manage to beat
Dover pretty often at football, but I always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
thought that coach of theirs had a good deal to
do with that!”</p>

<p>“Shucks, I’m not talking about athletics, although
that’s a pretty good test, too. What I
mean is that it’s the school that draws its enrollment
from all over the country and from all—er—classes
that does the biggest things; and
that’s the most use, too.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it,” answered Mart. “It’s
the school itself, its policy, its traditions that
count. You might have every state in the
Union—”</p>

<p>“Oh, that, of course, but I say that a student
body composed of a lot of totally different
types—”</p>

<p>“All right, but how are you going to get them?”</p>

<p>“Reach out for ’em! How do other schools
get ’em?”</p>

<p>“Search me, old son! Maybe they advertise
in the papers; Dakotas, New Mexico, Florida,
Hawaii—”</p>

<p>“Sure! Why not! This school’s in danger
of—er—dry-rot, Clem! Four hundred or so fellows
all alike, speaking the same language—”</p>

<p>“I should hope so!”</p>

<p>“Thinking the same thoughts, having the same
views on every subject. Gosh, can’t you see that
you and I don’t get as much out of it as if we
could rub up against something different now and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
then? Wouldn’t it be refreshing to find a fellow
who didn’t think just as we think about everything,
who didn’t wear exactly the same kind of
clothes, who didn’t think the sun rose and set in
New England?”</p>

<p>“But the sun does rise and set in New England,”
objected Clem. “I’ve seen it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up! You know what I mean.
Wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>Clem considered a moment. Then he shook his
head doubtfully. “You should have gone to
Kenly Hall, Mart,” he answered. “They have
all kinds there, the whole fifty-seven varieties.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and they’re better off for it. Of course
it’s the proper thing for us to make fun of Kenly,
but you know mighty well that it’s every bit as
good a school as Alton; maybe better in some
ways. But Kenly isn’t much different from us.
They get about the same lot year after year, just
as we do. One year’s freshman class looks just
like last year’s. Maybe they do get an occasional
outsider. Quite a few middle-west chaps go
there. But mostly they draw them from right
around this part of the country, as we do. Gee,
I’d certainly like to see, just for once, a fellow
turn up here who didn’t look as if he’d been cast
in the same mold with all the others!”</p>

<p>“You’re getting all worked up about nothing,
old son,” said Clem soothingly. “You mustn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
do it. It always upsets you so you can’t eat your
meals, and it’s only half an hour to supper.”</p>

<p>“If you weren’t so blamed stubborn—”</p>

<p>“Shut up a minute! Hello! Come in!”</p>

<p>The door of Number 15 opened slowly until the
more dimly lighted corridor was revealed through
a narrow aperture and a voice said: “Excuse me,
please, but is this where the fellow that hires the
football players lives?”</p>

<p>From where Martin sat the owner of the voice
was hidden, and so he could not account for the
radiant grin that enveloped his room-mate’s
countenance for an instant.</p>

<p>“I didn’t get it,” said Clem, politely apologetic.
“Won’t you come in?” His face was
sober again, unnaturally sober in the judgment
of Martin Gray.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the unseen speaker doubtfully.
Then the door again began its cautious passage
across the old brown carpet, and Mart understood
Clem’s grin.</p>

<p>The youth who now stood revealed to Mart’s
astounded gaze was little short of six feet tall,
it seemed. In age he might have been anywhere
from sixteen to twenty, with eighteen as a likely
compromise. He was attired neatly but, it appeared,
uncomfortably in a suit of dark gray
which fitted him too loosely across the shoulders
and too abruptly at the ankles, its deficiency at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the latter point exposing to Mart’s fascinated
eyes a pair of wrinkled woolen socks of sky-blue.
The low shoes were not extraordinary, but there
was something deliciously quaint about the collar,
with its widely parted corners, and the pale
blue satin tie that failed to hide the brass collar-stud.
Even the hat, a black Alpine shape, struck
a note of originality, possibly because it was a
full size too small and was poised so precariously
atop a thickish mass of tumbled hair that seemed
not yet to have decided just what shade of brown
to assume. Clem coughed delicately and asked:
“You were looking for some one?”</p>

<p>“Guess I’ve got the wrong place,” said the
stranger, his first embarrassment increasing at
the discovery of Mart beyond the door’s edge.
“The fellow I’m looking for is the one who hires—well,
takes on the football players. Guess he’s
the manager, ain’t he?”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” answered Clem, turning to Mart
with an inquiring glance. “What do you think?”</p>

<p>Martin took his cue promptly. “Or, maybe
the coach,” he suggested. “You don’t know his
name?”</p>

<p>The stranger shook his head. He held firmly
to the outer knob of the door, resting his shoulders
against the edge of it as he frowned in an
effort of memory. “I heard it,” he replied, “but
I forget what it was. He said I was to see him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
between five and six about me getting on the football
team and I thought he said he lived in Number
15 in Lykes Hall, but—”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, this isn’t—”</p>

<p>But Clem interrupted Mart swiftly. “Sit
down, won’t you?” he asked, smiling hospitably.
“I dare say we can thresh out the mystery. And
you might shove that door too, if you don’t mind.
Thanks.”</p>

<p>The stranger closed the door as slowly as he
had opened it, removed his hat and advanced gingerly
to the chair that Clem’s foot had deftly
thrust toward him. He gave them the impression
of having attained his growth so suddenly
as to be a little uncertain about managing it. He
lowered himself almost cautiously into the chair,
placing two rather large feet closely together and
holding his hat firmly by its creased crown with
both hands, hands generously proportioned,
darkly tanned and extremely clean. He looked
about the room and then back to Clem, while a
slow smile radiated the long, somewhat plain
face.</p>

<p>“You fellows got it right nice here,” he ventured.</p>

<p>“Like it?” asked Clem in a more friendly tone.
The stranger’s smile had transformed him on the
instant from a queer, almost uncouth figure to
something quite human and likable. “Yes, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
isn’t a bad room. Where do you hang out? By
the way, you didn’t mention your name, did
you?”</p>

<p>“Todd’s my name. My room’s over in Haylow;
Number 33. A fellow named Judson and I
have it together. It ain’t like this, though. Not
so big, for one thing, and then the ceiling comes
down, over there like, and I keep hitting my head
on it.”</p>

<p>Mart laughed. “They didn’t build you for
one of those third floor rooms, Todd.”</p>

<p>The slow smile came again and the gray eyes
twinkled, and the visitor relaxed a little in the
straight chair. “Gosh, I started to grow last
year and it looks like I can’t stop. I didn’t use
to be such an ungainly cuss.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t let that bother me,” returned
Mart. “You’ll fill out pretty soon, I dare say.
How tall are you?”</p>

<p>Todd shook his head. “I ain’t measured
lately,” he acknowledged a trifle sheepishly.
“Been scared to. Pop says if I don’t stop pretty
soon it won’t be safe for me to go out in the
woods less’n some one might mistake me for a
tree and put an ax to me!”</p>

<p>“Where’s your home?” asked Clem, with a
side glance at his room-mate.</p>

<p>“Four Lakes, Maine. At least, we don’t live
right in the village, but that’s our postoffice address.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
We live about three miles north, up the
Ludic road. You ever been around there?”</p>

<p>It seemed that they hadn’t, but once started
Todd was not averse to supplying personal information.
Clem fancied that Judson, whoever
he might be, had not proved a sympathetic listener
and that Todd was heartily glad to find some one
to talk to. His father had a store, it seemed,
and was also interested in timber lands and numerous
other interests. There was a large family
of children of which the present representative
was the senior member. He had been going
to school at Four Lakes until last Spring.</p>

<p>“I was set on going to college, you see, and I
thought I’d learned enough, but I went down to
Lewiston and talked with a fellow down there and
he said I’d better go to a preparatory school for
a couple of years first. I asked where and he
said this place. So I came down here. Seems
like he might have said some place nearer home,
but I guess it don’t matter. This looks like a
right nice school. I guess you fellows are seniors,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Juniors,” corrected Clem. “I suppose you’re
one of us, Todd.”</p>

<p>“I guess so. I ain’t heard for sure yet. They
started me off as a junior, though.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll make it,” declared Mart. “So
you’re going to play football, eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know.” Todd smiled embarrassedly.
“I ain’t ever yet, but this fellow I was
looking for stopped me this morning and asked
if I was going to and I said no, and then he asked
didn’t I want to and I said I didn’t know if I
did or not, and he said for me to come and see
him between five and six o’clock and we’d talk
about it. He said what his name was, but I forget.
I think he said he managed the players.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t,” inquired Clem very innocently,
“mention what position he thought you’d fill best
on the team?”</p>

<p>Todd’s gray eyes twinkled again. “No, he
didn’t, but I guess maybe one of the posts at the
end of the field’s got broken and he’s looking for
a new one.”</p>

<p>“I think it must have been Dolf Chapin you
saw,” said Mart, smiling at Clem’s slight discomfiture.
“He’s—”</p>

<p>“That’s the name,” declared Todd with relief.
“Where’s his room, please?”</p>

<p>“He’s in 15 Lykes.”</p>

<p>“Well, isn’t this—” Then Todd’s countenance
proclaimed understanding and he chuckled.
“Gosh, I went right by it, didn’t I? I was over
at that building where they have the library—”</p>

<p>“Memorial,” said Mart.</p>

<p>“And meant to stop at the first building after
I came off that path that comes from there. Instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of that I got right back in my own house,
didn’t I? I ain’t got this place learned very well
yet. Well, I’m much obliged to you. Maybe I’ll
see you again. My name, like I told you, is Todd,
Jim Todd.” He arose and offered a big hand to
Clem and then to Mart.</p>

<p>“Glad to have met you, Todd,” responded
Clem, spreading his fingers experimentally after
the crushing grip they had sustained. “My
name’s Harland, and this is Gray. Drop in again
some time, won’t you? I’d like mighty well to
hear how you get along with football.”</p>

<p>“Well, I ain’t so sure I’ll play it,” answered
Todd from the doorway, frowning a little. “I
guess playing games sort of interferes with a fellow’s
school work, and what I’ve seen of the
courses they’ve got me down for makes me think
I’ll have to do some tall studying. I’m glad to
have met you, and maybe I might come in and
see you again some time.”</p>

<p>“Do that,” said Clem earnestly.</p>

<p>Then the door closed slowly but decidedly and
Clem and Mart dropped back into their chairs.
After a moment Clem said: “Looks to me like
your prayer was answered, Mart.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s only one, but he’s a hopeful sign.”</p>

<p>Clem chuckled softly. “You and Todd ought
to get along pretty well together,” he continued.
“You wanted something different, and there you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
have it. At least, he doesn’t wear clothes like
the rest of us; he’s no slave to Fashion, old son.
Maybe he won’t mind telling you where he buys
his togs, eh?”</p>

<p>“Some way,” answered Mart, “it doesn’t seem
quite fair to make fun of him. There was something
awfully decent about the chap, in spite of
his clothes and his—er—queer appearance.”</p>

<p>“That’s true, and I wasn’t really making fun.
Only—” Clem interrupted himself with a laugh.
“Say, isn’t it just like Chapin to try to round
that fellow up for the football squad? Honest,
Mart, if a one-legged fellow showed up here and
Dolf saw him he wouldn’t be happy until he had
him out on the field!”</p>

<p>“At that,” replied Mart, as he arose to prepare
for supper, “Jim Todd might be a blamed
sight better player than some of those cripples
who lost the game last year for us! I noticed
that your delicate sarcasm was trumped very
neatly by our recent guest, old timer!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Clem acknowledged, “that’s so. I
fancy our friend James isn’t such a fool as his
hat makes him out!”</p>

<small>JIM TODD QUITS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The occupants of Number 15 Haylow didn’t see
anything more of Jim Todd for a while. In fact,
he had nearly gone from their memories when
Clem collided with him at the entrance to the
dormitory one day in late October. Jim only said
“Hello” and would have gone by, but something
prompted Clem to renew the acquaintance.</p>

<p>“Well, how do you like things now that you’ve
been with us awhile, Todd?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Fine, thanks. I’m getting on real well.”</p>

<p>“Good! By the way, you never paid that next
call, you know. Gray and I have been wondering
about you.” That was more flattering than
truthful perhaps. “Still playing football, or did
you decide not to go in for the manly pastime?”</p>

<p>Jim smiled. “Well, I’m still on the squad,”
he said, “but I don’t do very well at that game.
Guess I’ll be quitting this week. It’s pretty hard,
and it takes a good deal of a fellow’s time, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, if they’ve kept you all this time you’ll
probably last the season out,” responded Clem,
not a little surprised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>But Jim Todd shook his head. “I guess I’ll
be getting through pretty soon,” he said firmly.</p>

<p>“Well, drop in and see us again, anyway.”
Clem hurried on to a recitation, wondering most
of the way to Academy Hall why he had renewed
the invitation. Nothing came of it for nearly a
fortnight, however. Then, late one afternoon,
Mr. James Todd knocked and entered. Six weeks
had somewhat altered his appearance, and he
looked far less “different.” He was still the
same tall, loose-jointed chap, but he wore a gray
sweater and a pair of old blue trousers and no
hat, and so much of his oddity was missing. He
was, too, more at ease on this occasion, and settled
his long length back in the Morris chair that Clem
indicated without his former hesitation. Presently,
in the course of conversation, Mart observed:</p>

<p>“I’ve been looking for you on the football team,
Todd, but I missed you. Still, it’s hard to recognize
your friends under those leather domes
you fellows wear. You didn’t get into the Mount
Millard game, did you?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t been in any of them,” answered Jim.
“I ain’t much of a football player.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you’ve got two chances yet,” replied
Mart cheeringly. “Maybe Cade is keeping you
back for the Kenly Hall game.”</p>

<p>“I quit last week,” said Jim simply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“Quit? You mean—er—is that so?” floundered
Mart. “Well, maybe next year—”</p>

<p>“It was pretty hard work,” added Jim Todd.
“Pretty wearing. I got tired of it finally. Mr.
Cade and me had a sort of argument about it,
but I told him I wouldn’t ever make a football
man and that I had sort of got behind with my
studies and he let me go finally. I like him. He
got sort of mad with me, but I guess he’s over
it by now.”</p>

<p>Clem and Mart exchanged glances that indicated
puzzlement. “You mean,” asked Clem at
last, “that you resigned? You weren’t fired
off?”</p>

<p>“No, I just quit,” answered Jim untroubledly.
“You see, it’s like this, Harland. Most of the
fellows in the squad had played football before.
Some of them have been at it two or three years,
likely. It was new to me. Of course I’d seen
fellows playing it, you know; they had a sort of
a team at the school I went to back home; but it
never interested me much and I never thought
I’d care to try it. Well, I was pretty green when
I started off and I had a lot to learn. Guess I
didn’t learn very well, either. Seems like I was
pretty stupid about it. Mr. Cade said I didn’t
put my mind on it, but I don’t think that was so.
Guess the trouble was I didn’t get real interested
in it. He told me that if I worked hard this Fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
I’d likely get to play next year. He tried to make
an end of me, but I never got good enough to
play in any of the games. I just sat on that
bench out there at the field and looked on. They
keep you on the field two hours every afternoon;
sometimes longer than that; and I could see I was
just wasting my time. I kept saying so to Dolf
Chapin, but he said I wasn’t, that I was learning
and that it was my duty to stick it out. So I did
till last week. Then I decided I’d better quit.
So I quit.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Mart dryly. “And Johnny
Cade? I suppose he had something to say,
Todd.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he said a whole lot,” answered Jim
soberly. “Looked once like I’d have to paste
him in the jaw, the way he was talking, but I
didn’t because I knew he didn’t mean all he said.
He was sort of upset, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Sounds to me as if you were a more valuable
man than you realized,” said Clem.</p>

<p>“No, I guess I wasn’t very valuable, really. I
guess these football coaches like to have their
own way pretty well.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mart, laughing, “I’ll bet you’ve
earned the distinction of being one of the few fellows
that ever <em>resigned</em> from the squad! No
wonder Cade was grumpy! He’s not used to
that!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>There followed another lapse in the acquaintanceship.
Clem and Mart caught glimpses of
Jim Todd in class room and dining hall; infrequently
passed him on the campus; sometimes
exchanged greetings by word or sign. The Kenly
Hall game came and went, bringing the football
season to a disappointingly inconclusive end.
Beaten the year before, Alton tried desperately
to wreak vengeance, but, although her players
and her game were infinitely superior to those
of the preceding season, Kenly Hall, too, showed
improvement, and at the final whistle the score
stood just where it had stood at the end of the
first half, at 7 to 7. Each team had scored one
touchdown and followed it with a clean goal.
Each team, too, had narrowly failed of a second
score, Kenly Hall when a forward-pass over the
goal-line had been tipped but not caught and
Alton when a fourth down on the enemy’s four-yard
line had gained but one foot of the necessary
two. Both touchdowns had resulted from
long runs, a Kenly Hall quarter-back bringing
glory to the Cherry-and-Black by a thirty-four-yard
dash around the opponent’s left and
“Cricket” Menge, left half on the Gray-and-Gold
team, evening things up a few minutes later
by wrapping himself about a lateral pass and
dodging and twirling his way over eleven white
lines to a score.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>After the first disappointment, Alton Academy,
viewing the result more calmly and fairly, came
to the conclusion that her gridiron warriors had
gained more glory than had been thus far accorded
them. Both Kenly Hall coach and captain
had stated publicly that the team which had
met Alton was the best eleven that had represented
the Cherry-and-Black in six years, and if
that was so—and certainly Alton Academy had
no reason to doubt it!—then Captain Grant’s
team—“‘General’ Grant’s Army” the football
song called it—had secured a virtual victory in
spite of the score. Careful analysis of the contest
added strength to that verdict, for the records
showed that Alton had outrushed her opponent
by thirty-two yards, gained two more first
downs than her ancient enemy had secured and
had had slightly the better of the kicking argument.
So on Monday night there was a delayed,
but intensely enthusiastic, mass meeting in the
auditorium and honor was done to the heroes.
Everybody spoke who had any right to, and a
few who hadn’t, and there was much singing and
a great deal of cheering. Clem and Mart, neither
of them football enthusiasts, attended the celebration,
as in duty bound, and ended by cheering
quite as loudly as any. The testimonial had
one result that the school in general never learned
of. It decided a wavering Athletic Committee in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
favor of renewing Coach “Johnny” Cade’s contract,
which terminated that Fall, for another
two seasons. Prior to seven-thirty that Monday
evening his last two years’ record of one defeat
and one tie, even when balanced against previous
success, had looked more than black to the
Committee. At nine o’clock it was viewing that
record more leniently. And on Wednesday Coach
Cade departed with a new contract in his trunk.</p>

<p>When Clem came back to school after Christmas
he found a package awaiting him in the mail
box. Opened, it revealed a long, flat box of small
cubes wrapped in pink tissue paper. Investigation
proved the cubes to be spruce gum. There
was also a scrawling enclosure from Jim Todd.
“Wishing you a Merry Christmas,” Clem read.
“This is the real thing. Hope you like it. I’m
sending it to Alton because I don’t know where
you are. Give some to Gray. Yours, J. T.”</p>

<p>Mart declared that he detested gum and
wouldn’t chew the stuff on a bet, but after
watching Clem’s jaws rhythmically champing for
some ten minutes he perjured himself and was
soon as busy as his chum. Two days later, suffering
from lame jaws after almost continuous
chewing during waking hours, Clem seized the
box, now half empty, and consigned it to the
depths of the waste basket. “The pesky stuff!”
he grumbled. “First thing we know we’ll have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the habit!” Mart, one hand raised in protest,
recognized the wisdom of the course and observed
the sacrifice in silence. During the rest of that
day he chewed scraps of paper torn from the corners
of note-books. However, they lacked the insidious
fascination of spruce gum and he gave
them up and was cured. Of course they thanked
Jim heartily a few days later, when he dropped
in one afternoon, offering as conclusive evidence
of their appreciation the fact that the supply was
exhausted. Jim promptly promised to write to
his father and get him to send some more. Perhaps
he forgot it, for the new supply never
reached Number 15 Haylow.</p>

<p>It is possible that absorption in new interests
was accountable for Jim’s failure to make good
on that promise, for it was shortly after that
that Mart brought word of the Maine Society.
Neither he nor Clem was eligible to membership,
but that didn’t detract from their interest in the
Society which, as Mart had heard it from Sam
Newson, had been started by Jim Todd and already,
while still less than a fortnight old, had
a membership of nine. The school already possessed
a Southern Club and a Western Society,
but a social organization restricted to residents
of a single state in attendance at Alton was something
new and, like most innovations, it came in
for some ridicule. The notice board in Academy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Hall fairly blossomed with calls for members of
similar societies. Some one named Henry Clay
Calhoun, which may or may not have been a cognomen
assumed for the occasion, invited other
residents of South Carolina to meet in Number
14 Borden to effect the organization of “The
South Carolina Society of Alton Academy, Devoted
to the Abolishment of the Fifteenth Amendment
to the Constitution and to a Campaign of
Education and Enlightenment among the Beknighted
Citizens of Northern States.” As Borden
Hall was restricted to freshmen, the authenticity
of the invitation was questionable. The
same was true of a summons to resident Hawaiians,
while a document phrased in pidgin
English and summoning all Chinese students at
Alton to meet in the school laundry and enter
their names on the roster of “The Chinese Tong”
was even more palpably insincere. But ridicule
seemed just what the Maine Society required, for
a fortnight later it changed its name to the Maine-and-Vermont
Society and increased its membership
to thirty-one. A fellow named Tupper became
president of the reorganized club and James
Todd was secretary and treasurer. Meetings
were held weekly in the rooms of various members
at first, and then, securing faculty recognition,
the Society was assigned the use of a room
on the top floor of Academy Hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>By invitation of Jim Todd, Clem attended one
of the open meetings held monthly and was well
entertained. The sight of Jim slowly elongating
himself from behind the secretary’s table to read
the previous minutes was alone well worth the
effort of climbing two flights of stairs to Clem.
Jim was very earnest and recited the doings of
the last meeting in tones that imbued them with
a vast importance. “Moved and seconded,” read
Jim weightily, “that the Secretary be and hereby
is empowered to contract for a sufficient supply
of letter paper, appropriately printed with the
Society’s name and emblem, and a sufficient supply
of envelopes likewise so printed, the total
cost of the same not to exceed seven dollars, and
the same to be paid for out of the funds of the
Society. So voted.” There were light refreshments
later, and afterwards several members
spoke informally—often embarrassedly—on matters
of interest to citizens of the affiliated states.
The best of the number was undoubtedly the secretary
and treasurer. Jim was far more self-possessed
than of yore and he spoke in an easy
conversational style that pleased his hearers
mightily. What he had to tell wasn’t much; just
a somewhat rambling account of a visit to a logging
camp; but he made it interesting and displayed
a humorous perception that Clem, for one,
had never suspected him of. On the whole, Clem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
enjoyed the evening and was quite sincere when
he said as much to Jim on their way back to Haylow.
When they parted in the corridor, Clem
said:</p>

<p>“You haven’t been in to see us, Todd, for a
long time. We’re getting out of touch with
events, Mart and I. Better drop in some time
and cheer us up.”</p>

<p>Jim looked as if he suspected the other of joshing.
He was never absolutely certain about
Clem’s ingenuousness. “Well,” he answered,
“I’d been around before only I knew you were
pretty busy with hockey and—and all like that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hockey doesn’t take all my time,” said
Clem. “For instance, I don’t play much after
supper.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I meant that being captain of the
team you’d likely be pretty busy one way and
another. I’ll be dropping in some evening soon,
though, if you say so.”</p>

<p>“Wish you would. Good night!”</p>

<p>Seeking Number 15 and a bored Mart, who had
refused the invitation to the Maine-and-Vermont
Society with scathing remarks, Clem marveled
at the perfectly idiotic way in which he persisted
in fostering the acquaintance of Jim Todd. He
didn’t really care a hang about the queer chap,
of course, and— But hold on! Was that quite
true? Didn’t he rather like Jim, if the truth had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to be told? Well, yes, he sort of guessed he did.
There was something about Jim Todd that appealed
to him. Maybe—and he grinned as he
flung open the door of Number 15—it was just
Todd’s quality of being “different”!</p>

<p>A few days later Clem, smashing into the boards
of the outdoor rink, after a valiant effort to hook
the puck from Landorf, of the scrub six, almost
bumped heads with Jim Todd. It was a nippingly
cold February afternoon, and Jim made
one of the small audience that stamped about on
chilled feet and watched the progress of the practice
game. Jim, though, appeared less conscious
of the cold than most of the others. He had on
the old gray woolen sweater, and a cloth cap set
inadequately on the back of his streaky brown
locks. About him were overcoats—even one or
two of fur—and unfastened overshoes rattled
their buckles as their wearers kicked the wooden
barrier or stamped about on the hard-trodden
snow to encourage circulation. Jim wore a pair
of woolen socks of a dubious shade of tan and
low shoes that were ostensibly black. And he
didn’t prance about a bit. Once in a while he did
rub his long bony hands together, but the action
seemed an indication of interest in the hockey
game rather than in the temperature. As a matter
of fact, this was Jim’s first glimpse of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
a contest, and he was, for Jim Todd, quite excited
over it.</p>

<p>Between the halves Clem skated over to him.
“Aren’t you frozen?” he asked wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Me? No.” Jim shook his head slowly.
“It’s right cold, though, ain’t it? A whole lot
colder than we have it in Maine, I guess. Say,
what’s that thing made of you’re hitting around
on the ice?”</p>

<p>“Rubber. Haven’t you ever played hockey?”</p>

<p>“No. When I was a kid we used to whack a
block of wood around with sticks, but it wasn’t
much like this hockey. Looks like you’ve got almost
as many rules as there are in football.
You’re a pretty nice skater, ain’t you?”</p>

<p>“Not as good as some of the fellows,” replied
Clem. “You skate, of course.”</p>

<p>Jim nodded. “That’s ’bout the only thing I
can do real well,” he answered. “Don’t believe
I could get around the way you do, though; dodge
and turn so quick and all like that. I ain’t so
bad at skating fast, but I’ve got to have plenty
of room.”</p>

<p>“Better go into the races Saturday morning,”
suggested Clem. “What’s your distance?”</p>

<p>“Distance?”</p>

<p>“Yes, what are you best at? Half-mile?
Mile? Two miles?”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know. I’ve skated in a lot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
races, you might say, but we didn’t ever measure
them. We’d race, generally, from the old
boat-house to the inlet; on Lower Pond, you know.
Guess that’s about three-quarters of a mile; more
or less.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you enter for Saturday, then?”
asked Clem. “You ought to be able to do the
mile if you’ve been doing the three-quarters,
Todd.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know. Would you? Does it
cost anything?”</p>

<p>“Not a cent,” laughed Clem. “There’s a list
of the events over on the notice board in the gym.
Better pick out a couple and get your name
down.”</p>

<p>“Well— Gosh, though, I can’t! I didn’t
bring my skates. I sort of had a notion there
wasn’t much skating down here. I guess there
wouldn’t be time to send for them, either, to-day
being Tuesday.”</p>

<p>Clem leaned over the barrier and viewed Jim’s
shoes. “No, I guess not, but I think Mart’s
skates will fit you. Drop in later and we’ll see.
He doesn’t use them much.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he wouldn’t like me to have them,”
responded Jim doubtfully. “Anyway, I ain’t
skated since last winter, Harland, and I guess I
wouldn’t be much good. Much obliged to you,
but maybe I’d better not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, if you change your mind—” Clem
hurried away to try some shots at goal before
the whistle blew again.</p>

<p>Just before supper-time, however, Jim wandered
into Number 15. He announced that he
guessed he’d take part in those races if it was
all right about the skates. “There’s a two-mile
race down, I see, and I guess I’d like to try that.”</p>

<p>“Two miles? Thought you’d been doing three-quarters,”
said Clem, while Mart dug his skates
out of the closet.</p>

<p>“Yes, but sometimes I got licked, and I’ve got
a sort of notion I can do better at a longer distance.
Maybe I’ll try for the mile, too. I guess
there’s a lot of pretty good skaters going into
it, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so,” said Clem, “but you’ll
have a good time. You don’t mind getting beaten,
do you?”</p>

<p>Jim frowned slightly. “Why, yes, I guess I
do,” he replied. “Every fellow does, don’t he?”</p>

<p>“Well, I meant to say you didn’t mind much.
Of course no fellow wants to take a defeat, but
he has to do it just the same sometimes, you know.
And there’s a whole lot in taking it the right
way.”</p>

<p>“The right way?” inquired Jim.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, Todd. Look here, are you joshing
me? You know what I mean, confound you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know as I do,” said Jim doubtfully.
“I don’t get mad when I’m licked, if that’s
what you mean. Leastways, I don’t let on I’m
mad. But it don’t make me feel any too good
to get beat!”</p>

<p>“I suppose your trouble is that you’ve never
been beaten often enough to get used to it, then,”
answered Clem. “Getting mad doesn’t do any
good, you crazy goof. You want to smile and
make believe you like it.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“Oh, for the love of Liberty,” wailed Clem,
“take this fellow off me, Mart! He’s worse than
a Philadelphia lawyer!”</p>

<p>Mart’s return with the skates provided a diversion.
They were a size too small, but after
a long and admiring appraisal of them Jim declared
that they would do. “I never saw a pair
just like these before,” he confided admiringly.
“What they made of, Gray?”</p>

<p>“Aluminum, mostly. Light, aren’t they? Like
them?”</p>

<p>“Gosh, yes, but I don’t know if I can do much
with them. They don’t weigh more’n a third
what mine do. I’m going to try them, just the
same. I’m much obliged to you.”</p>

<p>“You’re welcome. Just see that you win a race
with them. We’ll go down and root for you,
Todd.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“I might win the two-mile race,” replied Jim,
“if I get so I can use these right. I’ll try ’em
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>They didn’t see Jim again until the morning
of the races. It was a corking day, that Saturday,
with a wealth of winter sunshine flooding
the world and only the mildest of northerly
breezes blowing down the river. The weather
and the list of events ought to have brought out
a larger representation of the student body, but
as a matter of fact by far the larger portion of
those who had assembled at ten o’clock were contestants.
Clem, yielding to the solicitations of
the Committee, had entered for three races at
the last moment, and it wasn’t until he had won
the 220-yard senior event in hollow fashion from
a field of more than a score of adversaries and
been narrowly beaten in the quarter-mile race
that he encountered Jim.</p>

<p>Jim had discarded his beloved gray sweater
and was the cynosure of all eyes in a mackinaw
coat of green and black plaid. The green was
extremely green and the plaid was a very large
one, and Jim presented an almost thrilling appearance.
Under the mackinaw, his lean body
was attired very simply in a white running shirt,
and Clem addressed him sternly.</p>

<p>“Want to catch pneumonia and croak?” he demanded.
“Don’t you know you can’t skate with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
that state’s prison offense on and that if you take
it off you’ll freeze stiff? Where were you when
they handed brains out, Todd?”</p>

<p>Jim grinned. “Hello,” he replied. “That
was a nice licking you gave all those other fellows.
And, say, if you’d got going quicker in
that other race you’d have made it, easy.”</p>

<p>Clem was looking attentively at the mackinaw.
Now he felt of it. “Say, that’s some coat, son.
Where’d you get it?”</p>

<p>“Back home.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet it’s warm. I never saw one made of
as good stuff as that is. Any more like it where
it came from?”</p>

<p>Jim chuckled. “I’m going to write pop to
send down a couple dozen of them,” he said.
“You’re about the tenth fellow that’s asked me
that so far. I could sell a lot of ’em if I had
’em.”</p>

<p>“Joking aside, though, can I get one, Todd?”</p>

<p>“Sure. Pop sells them. I’ll give you the address
if you want to send for one. I’ve given it
to a lot of fellows already.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, if the whole school’s going to come
out in them I guess I’ll pass,” said Clem regretfully.
“I suppose those are what the lumbermen
wear, eh?”</p>

<p>Jim nodded. “Lots of folks wear them.
They’re mighty good coats. Only six dollars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
too. Better have one. Maybe pop’ll give me a
commission.”</p>

<p>“Six dollars! I believe you’re trying to make
a dollar rake-off on each one! Say, what are you
down for, Todd?”</p>

<p>“Down for? Oh, the mile and two miles.
You?”</p>

<p>“Just the half. I’ll get licked, too. See you
later. But, honest, Todd, you oughtn’t to skate
two miles in just that cotton shirt, you know.”</p>

<p>“Warm enough. It ain’t real cold to-day.
Hope you win.”</p>

<p>But Clem didn’t, making rather a sorry showing
in fact.</p>

<p>There was an obstacle race for the younger
chaps next, an event that provided plenty of
amusement for entrants and spectators alike, and
then the contestants for the mile were called.
This event was a popular one, it appeared, for
sixteen youths of all ages and from all classes
answered. A group of freshmen, about twenty
in all, cheered lustily and unflaggingly for their
favorite, a small, slim, capable appearing boy
named Woodside. Jim towered over most of the
lot, although his bare brown head didn’t top that
of Newt Young, guard on the football team and
a senior entrant. The seniors were represented
by several others, but their hopes were pinned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
on Newt. The bunch sped away at the crack of
a pistol and were soon well spread out.</p>

<p>Jim didn’t have much hope of capturing that
race, and certainly no one who watched him could
have censured him. Jim’s skating was far from
graceful. He didn’t suggest the flight of a bird,
for instance. Observing Jim, you were reminded
chiefly of a windmill that had somehow got loose
and was blowing down the ice, blowing fast, to
be sure, but wasting a deal of motion. Jim’s
arms did strange antics, seeming never to duplicate
a single movement that was once made. And
he appeared to have more than the usual number
of joints in his long, thin body. He bent everywhere;
at knees, waist, shoulders, neck, elbows
and wrists; and some other places, too, unless
sight deceived the onlookers. But at the quarter
distance he was still among the first half-dozen,
and when the turn was made those at the
finish couldn’t determine for some moments
whether he or young Woodside led.</p>

<p>It promised to be a close finish, in any case,
for behind the two leaders sped Newt Young,
showing lots of reserve, and, not yet out of the
race, four others followed closely. But Jim began
to fall back after the race was three-fourths
over, and for a hundred yards Woodside loomed
as the winner, while his enthusiastic classmates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
howled ecstatically. Then, however, Young edged
past Jim and set off after the freshman and for
the final fifty yards it was nip and tuck to the
line. Young won by a bare three feet, with
Woodside second and Jim a poor third.</p>

<p>“Well, feel mad, do you?” asked Clem as he
and Mart sought Jim.</p>

<p>Jim scowled and then grinned sheepishly. “I
could have won if I’d had my own skates,” he
muttered. “These are all right, only I ain’t used
to them. Bet you I could beat that big fellow if
I had my own skates.”</p>

<p>“Newt Young?” asked Mart. “Well, Newt’s
a pretty good lad, they say.”</p>

<p>“I could beat him,” reasserted Jim doggedly.
“He gave me a jab in the nose, too.”</p>

<p>“What? Newt did?” Clem was incredulous.
“I didn’t see it. Where was it?”</p>

<p>“Playing football, I mean,” answered Jim.
“He was on the first squad when I was playing.
He gave me a good one one day, and I don’t guess
it was any accident, neither.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” murmured Clem sadly, “I fear yours is
a vindictive nature, Todd. I am disappointed
in you.”</p>

<p>Jim observed him doubtfully. Then he said
“Huh!” Finally he grinned. “Well, he didn’t
have any cause to hit me,” he added, “and I sort
of wanted to beat him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“Maybe he’s down for the two miles,” suggested
Mart cheerfully. “Do you know?”</p>

<p>Jim didn’t know, but Clem did. “He is,” declared
the latter. “So go ahead and wreak vengeance,
Todd. You have my blessing. And I
guess they’re about ready for you, too.”</p>

<p>“Gosh, I wish I had my own skates,” muttered
Jim wistfully.</p>

<p>“No alibis, Todd,” said Clem sternly. “Do
your duty.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>CLEM GETS A LETTER</small></h2>
</div>


<p>There were only five entries for the two-mile
race, all senior and junior class fellows. The
course was twice around the half-mile flag, which
made for slower time but enabled the audience to
keep the skaters in sight. The five started briskly
from the mark, but this event called for less speed
than had the one-mile race, and none of the contestants
seemed especially anxious to set the pace.
It was, finally, Newt Young who took the lead,
with a junior named Peele next and Jim Todd
third. That order held to the turn and all the
way back to the line. Some one clocked Young
at three minutes and eighteen seconds, but in
view of the final figures that timing may have
been wrong. The line was well strung out when
it turned again toward the distant flag, with the
first three skaters at four-yard intervals and the
last two close together a hundred feet back. Not
until the figures had grown small in the distance
once more did the order change. Then the spectators
saw Jim Todd pass Peele and fall in close
behind the leader. That was a signal for triumphant
cheers from a small coterie of devoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
sons of the Pine Tree State, to whose voices Clem
and Mart added theirs. Such triumph was, however,
short-lived, for when Jim, still threshing
his long arms about, took the turn around the
flag he tried to make it too short and the watchers
had a confused vision of the white-shirted youth
going over and over, with legs and arms whirling,
far across the distant surface.</p>

<p>“That,” observed Clem dryly, “lets our Mr.
Todd out of it.”</p>

<p>The capsized one made a really astounding recovery
and was on his blades again almost before
the spectators had sensed the catastrophe, but
Peele had passed him by that time, and Young
was well away on his last dash. The other two
contestants, while still grimly pursuing, were already
out of the result. The half-dozen “Maniacs,”
as Clem dubbed them not very originally,
refused to own defeat for their favorite and continued
to howl imploringly for Jim to “Come on
and win it!” It is doubtful if Jim heard that demand,
for he was still a long way off and there
was plenty of other shouting beside that of the
Maine contingent, but it did look as if he had,
quite of his own accord and without prompting,
made up his stubborn mind to do that very thing!
He went after Peele desperately and gradually
closed the distance. Then, while the growing excitement
of the onlookers became every instant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
more vocal, he edged past his classmate and
steadily widened the ice between them. Doubtless
the fast-flying Young looked horribly like the
victor to Jim just then; he surely looked so to
those at the line; and probably the best that Jim
hoped for was a close finish. In any event, Jim
came hard, desperately, arms flying all ways at
once, a wild, many-jointed figure that seemed
somehow to fairly eat up distance.</p>

<p>At the quarter-mile he was undoubtedly gaining
on Young, and public sympathy, ever tending
toward the under dog, veered from the senior
suddenly and surprisingly, and the loyal sons of
Maine found their hoarse ravings drowned under
a greater volume of cheers for Jim Todd. “Come
on, Todd! You can beat him!” “Skate, Skinny
Boy! Come on! Come on!” “You’ve got him,
Todd! Hit it up! Hit it up!” Even Mart, who
was a most reticent youth when it came to public
vocal demonstrations, appeared to be trying very
hard to climb Clem’s back and yelling: “<em>Todd!
Todd! Todd! Todd!</em>” in the most piercing tones
about four inches from Clem’s left ear. Clem,
though, failed to comment on the phenomenon at
the time, being extremely busy enticing Todd to
the finish with both voice and gesture!</p>

<p>It was somewhere about three hundred yards
short of the line that Jim realized that defeat
was not necessarily to be his portion, that Newt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Young’s admirable grace and form were at last
lacking and that that youth was probably as tired
as Jim Todd was. Jim devoutly hoped he was
even more tired, although he couldn’t conceive
of such a thing! Any one who has taken a
header in an ice race knows that it produces a
most enervating effect and, for a time at least,
leaves one in a painfully breathless condition.
Perhaps Jim recalled that, in his opinion, superfluous
tap on the nose of some three months
previous, and perhaps the recollection of that
painful indignity urged him to superhuman effort.
That as may have been, the runaway windmill
kept on closing the gap, slowly but inexorably.</p>

<p>The distance between the two dwindled from
eight yards to half that many, from four yards
to two, from two to one! They were almost stride
for stride as they swept down on the finish line.
Young, suddenly aware of the loss of his advantage,
seemed at once incredulous and disheartened.
There was a brief instant when he faltered,
and in that instant Jim swept into the
lead. Perhaps thirty yards still lay before the
adversaries, and Young seized on his courage
and determination again. But once in the lead
Jim was not to be headed. Indeed, it seemed
that until the instant of passing Young he had
not shown what real speed was! The tall youth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
found in those last few yards some joints he had
not suspected the possession of, made surprising
use of them, swayed, bent, buckled and
threshed down the ice with the lithe grace of a
camel with a hundred-mile gale behind it, and
gyrated across the finish line a good eight yards
ahead of his adversary!</p>

<p>The sons of Maine went crazy, every one yelled
and the official timekeeper proclaimed that the
school record had been burst into infinitesimal
fractions! As no one seemed to know what the
Alton Academy record for the two miles was,
the present time of six minutes and forty-one
seconds was accepted as something to cheer for.
So every one cheered again. And about that
time Young pushed through to Jim Todd and
shook hands with him, and Jim grinned and forgot
to say anything about that incident on the
gridiron, and every one went home.</p>

<p>But Jim Todd leaped into mild and momentary
fame, and for some weeks was pointed out as
“that long drink of water who beat Newt Young
on the ice and broke the school record for the
mile or two miles or something.” Perhaps his
fame would have lived longer if, at about that
time, Alton hadn’t played her final hockey game
with Kenly Hall and smeared up the Cherry-and-Black
to the tune of 7 goals to 3, a feat which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
after last season’s defeat for Alton, was hailed
with joy and loud acclaim and resulted later in
the election of Clement Harland to succeed himself
as captain of the team. Since Clem had been
the first youth to get the hockey captaincy in his
junior year in the history of that sport at Alton,
he was now possessor of the unique distinction
of being the only hockey captain ever serving two
terms. Mart sniffed and said he hoped Clem
wouldn’t get a swelled head over it, but that he
probably would and so wouldn’t be fit to live
with much longer!</p>

<p>Whether Clem was fit to live with or wasn’t,
it strangely happened that Mart never had an
opportunity to reach a decision in the matter, for
after Spring recess Mart came back to Alton
with a vast distaste for exertion and a couple
of degrees of temperature that he hadn’t had
when he went away. A day later he went to the
infirmary and there he stayed until well into May
with a case of typhoid that seemed to give much
satisfaction to the doctor in charge but that failed
to please Mart’s parents to any noticeable degree.
It was a strange, washed-out looking Mart
who rolled away one morning in an automobile
for the station on his way home, and while his
smile was recognizable by Clem the rest of him
seemed strange and alien. Mart managed a joke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
before the car started off, but it was such a weak,
puerile effort that Clem found it easier to cry
than laugh over.</p>

<p>During the rest of the term Clem saw more of
Jim Todd than ever, for Jim had been sincerely
concerned about Mart and had offered all sorts
of well-meant but impossible services during the
illness, and Clem had liked the kindness and
thoughtfulness shown. Besides, Clem felt a bit
lonesome after Mart’s departure, and Jim was
handy. On one or two occasions Clem even
climbed to the upper floor and endured the presence
of Bradley Judson for the sake of Jim. Judson,
who shared the sloping-ceilinged room with
Jim, was no treat, either, according to Clem!</p>

<p>At home, Mart wrote an occasional brief letter.
He said he was getting along finely, but the
letters didn’t sound so. Jim, however, who, it
turned out, had seen typhoid fever before, reassured
Clem. Typhoid, declared Jim, left you
pretty low in your mind and weak in your body,
and it took a long while for some folks to get
back where they had been. So Clem took comfort.
And then June arrived suddenly, and the
school year was over.</p>

<p>Toward the end of July, Clem, who was leading
a life of blissful ease at the Harland summer
home in the Berkshires, received a letter from
Jim. He didn’t know it was from Jim until he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
had looked at the bottom of the second sheet, for
the writing was strange to him and the inscription
on the envelope—“Middle Carry Camps,
Blaisdell’s Mills, Me.”—failed to suggest the
elongated Mr. Todd. Clem tucked his tennis
racket under his arm, seated himself on the lower
step of the porch and, seeking the beginning of
the missive, wondered what on earth Jim was
writing about. He wouldn’t have been much
more surprised had the letter been from the
President and summoning him to Washington to
confer on the Tariff! He hadn’t seen or heard
from Jim since June, and, since life had been
full of a number of things, hadn’t thought of him
more than a dozen times. And now Jim was
writing him a two-page letter in queer up-and-down
characters and faded ink on the cheap stationery
of a Maine sporting camp!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Friend Harland (Clem read): I guess you’ll be surprised
to get a letter from me and will wonder what in
tuck I am writing about. I just heard last week that
Mart Gray’s folks have taken him to Europe and that
he will not be back to school this next year. I’m right
sorry he don’t pick up faster, but that’s the way it is
with typhoid lots of times. What I’m writing about is
whether you have made any arrangement with any other
fellow to room in with you. You see, Harland, it is
like this. I wasn’t very well fixed where I was last year.
Judson is all right, I guess, only I don’t cotton to him
much. And I was thinking that perhaps if you didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
have any fellow in view to room in with you now that
Gray won’t be back, perhaps you wouldn’t mind me.
Of course, you may have some other in mind. I guess
likely you have, but I thought there wouldn’t be any
harm in asking.</p>

<p>“I’m right easy to get along with and I’m neat about
the place. I guess that’s about all I can say for myself,
but you know me well enough to know that we would
likely get along pretty well together if you thought well
of the notion. Anyway, I’d like you to answer this
when you get time and let me know. It will be all right
just the same if you don’t like the notion or have
made other arrangements. I just thought I’d take a
chance.</p>

<p>“I’m up here at this place guiding. I’m just a local
guide. I’m having a right good time and the pay is
pretty fair. There are about seventy folks here this
month and lots of women and children. Mostly I look
after the women and kids, take them out in the boats
or canoes and fishing. There’s good fishing here all
right, and if you ever want to catch some good bass you
come to this camp some time. I guess you wouldn’t be
able to come up for a spell this summer. I would show
you where you could catch them up to three pounds and
no joking. The regular guides here are a fine lot of
fellows, and we have some pretty good times. They eat
you well, too, here. I’d like for you to come on up if
you could, if only for a week. I would guarantee you
to catch more fish here in a week than you would most
anywhere else in a month. Well, let me hear from you,
please, pretty soon, because whatever way you say I’m
going to see if I can’t make a change this fall. I hope
you are having a pleasant summer. Yours sincerely,
James H. Todd.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Clem smiled when he had finished the letter.
Then he frowned. It was going to be rather
awkward. How could he tell Jim that he didn’t
want him for a room-mate without hurting the
chap’s feelings? “It will be all right just the
same if you don’t like the notion or have made
other arrangements.” Clem reread the sentence
and smiled wryly. It was all well enough
for Jim Todd to say that, but Clem knew very
well that it wouldn’t be “just the same.” The
difficulty was that he hadn’t made other arrangements.
He might tell Jim that he had, but that
would be a lie, and Clem didn’t like lies. Besides,
Jim would find out he had lied, and be a
lot more hurt than if he had been told the unflattering
truth! Clem wished mightily that he
could have foreseen this situation and written to
Mr. Wharton, the school secretary, as soon as
the tidings of Mart’s withdrawal had come.
Wharton would have arranged things for him in
a minute. Instead, though, he had kept putting
the matter off, and now this had happened. Gosh!</p>

<p>Clem recalled the fantastic figure that had
wandered into Number 15 that afternoon. If the
fellow would only dress less like a—a backwoodsman—it
would be something. Then Clem recalled
the fact that toward the end of the Spring
term Jim had looked a great deal more normal
as to attire. Clem sighed perplexedly. He liked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Jim, too, he reflected. There were lots of nice
traits in the fellow. In fact, after Mart had gone
home he had preferred Jim’s society to that of
most of the other chaps he knew in school; and
he knew a good many, too. Then what was wrong
with having Jim for a room-mate? Clem pondered
that for some time. “Raw” appeared to
be the most damaging charge he could bring
against the applicant, and that didn’t seem to him
an altogether sufficient indictment. Clem had
never suspected himself of being a snob, but just
now the possibility occurred to him abruptly and
unpleasantly. To get away from the idea he reread
Jim’s letter, and this time he read as much
between the lines as in them.</p>

<p>It had taken courage to write that letter, he
told himself. He would wager that Jim had put
it off more than once and had made more than
one false start. There was a humility all through
it that was almost pathetic when one remembered
that the writer wasn’t much under six feet in
height! Yes, and he wasn’t so small other ways,
Clem reflected. Considering that he had entered
Alton without knowing a soul there, and had burst
smack into the junior year, too, Jim had done
pretty well. He was no pill, even if he did wear
queer things and could be held accountable for
the epidemic of loud-plaid mackinaws that had
raged violently throughout the school in the late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Winter! He had flivvered at football, to be sure,
but he had won momentary fame as a skater, and
he had organized the Maine-and-Vermont Club.
That last feat proved pretty conclusively, thought
Clem, that the fellow had something in him.
After all, then, the worst you could say of him
was that he was—Clem searched diligently for
the word he wanted and found it—uncouth!</p>

<p>His thoughts went back to the afternoon when
Jim Todd had first edged into view and to Mart’s
almost impassioned utterances just previous
thereto. Clem smiled. Mart had been hankering
for new types and then Jim had walked in
quite as if he had been awaiting his cue off-stage!
Clem’s smile, though, was caused by the recollection
that Mart hadn’t been nearly so enthusiastic
about “new blood” in the concrete—meaning
Jim Todd—as he had been in “new
blood” in the abstract! Mart had tolerated Jim,
but had never derived much pleasure from the
acquaintanceship. Old Mart was a heap more
conservative than he had thought himself!</p>

<p>Then, thinking of Mart, Clem remembered how
perfectly corking Jim had been during Mart’s
illness. If he hadn’t done a great deal to help
it was only because there had been so little he
could do. He had always been ready, always
eager, always sympathetic. Yes, and there were
those two days when poor old Mart had been so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
beastly sick, and Clem had worried himself miserable,
or would have if Jim hadn’t sort of stuck
around and kept telling him that folks could be
awfully ill with typhoid and yet pull out all
hunky; that he’d seen it more’n once. Why, come
to think of it, there had been three or four days
when Jim had been with him half the time! How
had he done it? He must have missed class more
than once, and as for studying—well, he just
couldn’t have studied!</p>

<p>Clem got up very suddenly, stuffed Jim’s letter
in a pocket of his white flannels and stared
savagely at an inoffensive palm in a gray stone
jar. But though he looked at the palm he didn’t
seem to be addressing it when he spoke, for what
he said was: “Clem, you’re a low-lived yellow
pup! Get it?”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>A NEW TERM BEGINS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Clem returned to school the day before the beginning
of the Fall term to find Alton looking sun-smitten
and feeling exceedingly hot. The air,
after the fresh, sweet breezes of the Berkshires,
seemed stale and stifling, although when the cab
had borne him past the business section of the
town and residences surrounded by lawns and
gardens and shaded by trees had taken the place
of brick blocks there was a perceptible change
for the better. It had been a dry summer and
the campus showed it as Clem was hurried up
Meadow street. The trees looked droopy and the
grass parched. The buildings lined across the
brow of the campus had a deserted appearance,
with only here and there a window open to the
faint stir of air. He almost wished he had
waited until to-morrow.</p>

<p>The cab swerved to the right, proceeded a short
distance along the gravel and stopped with a sudden
setting of squeaking brakes in front of the
first building. Clem helped the driver upstairs
with the trunk, their feet echoing hollowly in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
empty corridors. Number 15 was hot and close,
and Clem sent the two windows banging up even
before he paid the cabman. When the latter had
gone clattering down again Clem removed his
jacket and looked speculatively about him. The
old room looked sort of homelike, after all, he
concluded. He was glad that Mart had decided
to leave his furnishings and pictures for the present.
Jim Todd’s possessions up in Number 29,
as Clem recalled them, were few and more useful
than ornamental! Of course, Clem could
have spread his own pictures and things about a
bit more, but they’d probably have looked sort
of thin. He opened the door of Mart’s closet
and the drawers of his chiffonier and sighed as
he saw what a deal of truck there was to be
packed. However, he had the rest of the afternoon
and most of the morning for his task. He
routed a packing-case of Mart’s from the basement
store-room, tugged it up to the room and
started to work.</p>

<p>At five o’clock he had made the disconcerting
discovery that Mart’s clothing and books and
small possessions, which had seemed to bulk so
large before, wouldn’t fill the big box more than
three-quarters full, and had thrown himself into
a chair to consider the fact and cool off when
footsteps sounded below the window and then
came nearer up the stairs. Then a voice sounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“You up there, Clem?”</p>

<p>“Yes! Come on up!”</p>

<p>“Saw your window open,” panted Lowell
Woodruff as he came in, looking very warm, “and
thought you must be up here. How are you?”
The two shook hands, and Lowell subsided on the
window-seat. “What’s brought you back so
early?”</p>

<p>Clem pointed to the packing-case. “Mart’s
not coming back this fall, and I’ve got the job
of getting his stuff packed up and shipped home
to him.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Yes, I heard he was off to the Continong,
lucky brute! What price a winter on
the Riviera, eh? Some guys get it soft! Who’s
coming in here with you?”</p>

<p>“A chap named Todd. You know him, I guess.
He’s in our class.”</p>

<p>“Jim Todd? Sure I know him! And I’d like
to meet up with the silly ass, too. He got notice
to report for early practice, and he hasn’t
shown hide nor hair.”</p>

<p>“Football?” Clem laughed. “I don’t believe
you’ll catch him, Woodie. Didn’t you know he
tried it last year and resigned?”</p>

<p>“Crazy nut!” said Lowell disgustedly. “Sure,
I knew it, but that’s got nothing to do with this
year. Listen, that guy ought to be able to play
football, Clem. He was all right for a fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
who didn’t know anything about it, but he didn’t
get handled right, see? He’s queer. Stubborn,
too, sort of. And Dolf Chapin wouldn’t see it.
You know Dolf. Thinks every one’s got to dance
when he fiddles. Todd got discouraged and told
Dolf so and Dolf laughed at him and told him
to quit his kidding. Bet you I could have kept
Todd going and made him like it.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you?” asked Clem.</p>

<p>“What chance? You know Dolf. Nice guy
and all that, but no one else must say a word
when he’s around. An assistant coach here
hasn’t any say about anything. All he does is
run errands and pick up things that the players
throw down. I could see that Todd was getting
tired and—”</p>

<p>“You really think he could play?” asked Clem
incredulously.</p>

<p>“Jim Todd? Sure he could! Why not? Put
twenty pounds on him—”</p>

<p>“How would you do it?”</p>

<p>“Feed him up, of course. Pshaw, fellows like
him don’t know what to eat. Three weeks at
training table would put the tallow on him so you
wouldn’t know him!”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t he at table last Fall?”</p>

<p>“No. He would have been if he’d stuck a few
days longer, I guess, but there were six or eight
fellows who didn’t come to the table until after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the Hillsport game. That was another of Dolf’s
fool notions.”</p>

<p>“How many fellows have you got here now?”</p>

<p>“Fourteen. Billy Frost didn’t show up; missed
a steamer or something; and a couple more failed
us. Your friend Todd was one. He didn’t even
write and tell us to chase ourselves, drat him!
And we need another tackle like thunder.”</p>

<p>“Tackle!” Clem whistled. Then he chuckled.
“Gosh, Woodie, I can’t see Jim Todd playing
tackle! How’d you happen to send him a call,
anyway? Thought you only had the old players
back for this early season stunt.”</p>

<p>“We needed tackles, like I’m telling you, and
both Johnny and I liked Todd’s looks last season,
and there weren’t many fellows for the position.
Doggone it, Clem, you don’t realize that
<a href="#image02">we lost most of the team last June</a>!”</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_53">We lost most of the team last June.</a></div>
</div>

<p>“How come? Billy Frost, Charley Levering,
Fingal, Whittier—”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure! And ‘Pep’ Kinsey and ‘Rolls’
Roice; but outside of Billy and Gus Fingal and
Pep Kinsey they’re all new men, aren’t they?
Sure, they played against Kenly, but that don’t
make ’em veterans! We’ve got to build a whole
new team—pretty near, Clem. That’s why I
want all the fellows I can get who happen to
know a football from a chocolate sundae, and
that’s why I’d like to see this here Jim Long-legged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Todd and tell him what I think of him!”</p>

<p>“Stick around until to-morrow and you’ll get
a chance. But I don’t believe you’ll dent him
any. I guess he’s through with football, if he
ever began.”</p>

<p>“Can’t help that, old son. We’ve got to have
him; him and two or three others who quit last
year for one reason or another; usually on account
of trouble with the office. I’m gunning for
’em. Say, Clem, you might help a bit, you know.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Well, you and Todd are sort of thick, I suppose.
He’d listen to you, wouldn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Maybe. Meaning you want me to talk him
around to going back? Any inducements?”</p>

<p>“How do you mean inducements?” asked
Lowell suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Well, a banana royal at The Mirror, for instikance.”</p>

<p>“Sure! Just the same, it’s Johnny who ought
to pay for it. It isn’t my funeral whether any
one plays or doesn’t play, is it?”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re manager, aren’t you?” laughed
Clem. “What’s the manager for if not to do the
dirty work and foot the bills? Besides, you’ll
work that banana royal into the expense account
somehow!”</p>

<p>“A fat chance!” scoffed Lowell. “Why, you
can’t buy a pair of shoe-laces without showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
a voucher for it! Oh, well, I’ll stand for your
drink.”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll let you off, Woodie. But don’t bank
too much on seeing Todd out there. I’ll do what
I can, but when you said he was a nut you spoke
a mouthful. By the way, who’s your trusty lieutenant
this year?”</p>

<p>“A fellow named Barr, Johnny Barr. Know
him? Not a bad sort, Johnny. There’s likely to
be some confusion, though. Some day I’ll yell
‘Johnny’ and Johnny Cade will think I’m getting
fresh and crown me!”</p>

<p>“I hope I’m there,” laughed Clem. “Where
are you eating to-night?”</p>

<p>“Anywhere you say, if you’re host.”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing. I’m talking Dutch. How
about the Beanery?”</p>

<p>“All right. What time? I’m going to get
under a shower before I’m ten minutes older.
It was as hot as Tophet on that field to-day!”</p>

<p>“Say half-past six. I’ll meet you in front of
Upton.”</p>

<p>“You will not. I’m in Lykes this year. Got
the room Spence Halliday had; Number 9; hot
stuff!”</p>

<p>“No! Who’s with you? Billy Frost?”</p>

<p>“No, ‘Hick’ Powers. Come and see our magnificence.
Should think you’d have changed,
Clem.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“What for? You’ve got nothing in your dive
the Lykes of this!”</p>

<p>“Oh, good <em>night</em>! I’m off! Six-thirty, eh?
If I’m not there, step inside and yell. So
long!”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute! Listen, Woodie. What would
you do with this junk? There’s only enough
stuff to fill that case about three-quarters full,
and if I ship it like that it’ll be an awful mess
when it arrives, I guess. What’s the answer?”</p>

<p>“Stick in some of your own things.”</p>

<p>“No, but really! No joking, Woodie. What
would—”</p>

<p>“Have a heart! Have a heart!” Lowell
waved his hands protestingly at the doorway.
“Boy, I’ve got <em>problems</em>! Don’t pester me with
trifles like that!”</p>

<p>The football manager was off, taking the stairs
four at a time. Clem went to the window and
leaned over the sill. When Lowell emerged from
the doorway below he hailed him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Woodie!”</p>

<p>“Yeah, what you want?” Lowell peered up
blinkingly through the sunlight.</p>

<p>“Listen, Woodie,” went on Clem earnestly.
“Haven’t you got half a dozen old footballs over
at the gym that you can’t use?”</p>

<p>“Old foot— Say, what’s your trouble? What
do you want ’em for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“To fill up this box,” jeered Clem. “Run
along, sonny!”</p>

<p>Clem didn’t pass a very restful night. For one
thing, Number 15 Haylow was hot and stuffy.
Then, too, Clem and Lowell Woodruff and two
other fellows had sought to mitigate the heat of
the evening by partaking of many and various
concoctions of ice cream and syrups, and his
stomach had faintly protested for some time. He
awoke in the morning, scandalously late, from
what seemed to have been a night-long succession
of unpleasant dreams. But a bath and
breakfast set him right, and afterwards he completed
the packing of Mart’s belongings. By
rummaging about in the store-room he collected
enough pieces of corrugated straw-board and excelsior
and old newspapers to fill the top of the
packing-case after a fashion, and he hammered
the lid down with vast relief, addressed it with
a paper spill dipped in the ink bottle and pushed
it into the corridor. A visit to the express office
completed his responsibilities, and, since it was
then only a little after ten, he returned to school
and took the path that led, between Academy and
Upton Hall, and past the gymnasium, to the athletic
field.</p>

<p>Morning practice was already in full swing
when he reached the gridiron, and the small squad
of perspiring youths were throwing and catching,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
punting and chasing half a dozen pigskins about
the field. Clem greeted the trainer, whose real
name was Jakin but who was never called anything
but Jake, was introduced by Lowell to
Johnny Barr, the assistant manager, and exchanged
long-distance greetings with several of
the players. Then he found a seat on the edge
of the green wheelbarrow in which Peter, Jake’s
underling, trundled the football paraphernalia
back and forth from the gymnasium and looked
on. It wasn’t a vastly interesting scene. Clem,
who, while he thoroughly enjoyed watching a football
contest, had never felt any urge to play the
game, wasn’t able to get any thrill from watching
practice. He amused himself identifying
some of the candidates, not such an easy task
when old gray jerseys, ancient khaki pants and
disreputable stockings comprised the attire of
each and every one and effectually disguised individuality.
There, however, was Gus Fingal,
the captain, tall, with hair the color of new rope;
and Charley Levering, taller and lighter and as
black of head as a burnt match; and Pep Kinsey,
a solid chunk of a youth slated for quarter-back
position. And the big, square fellow was, of
course, Hick Powers, and the long-legged chap
farther down the field who was trying drop-kicks
none too successfully was Steve Whittier. The
others Clem couldn’t place until Lowell came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
his assistance. Lowell pointed out Roland Roice—it
was fated that he should be known as ‘Rolls’!—Sawyer,
Crumb, Cheswick, two or three others,
but Clem wasn’t greatly interested. Later,
Coach Cade came off the field and shook hands.
Johnny, as he was called by the fellows, though
not to his face, was perspiring freely, and his face
was the color of a ripe tomato. The coach was
a short man, perhaps twenty-eight years of age,
with a broad, solid body, a head of thick, bristle-like
black hair and two sharp eyes set wide apart.
Clem reflected, not for the first time, that Johnny
Cade must have been a bad man to say “Whoa”
to on a football field in his playing days! He
had a regular fighting chin under that smiling
mouth of his. Just now, having exchanged greetings
with Clem, he was mopping his face with
the sleeve of a tattered jersey.</p>

<p>“Hot, isn’t it?” he asked. “We’ve had nearly
a week of it here. Mean weather for football
work. We usually get it about like this every
Fall, though. Sometimes I doubt that this pays
very well; this before-season practice. I don’t
know but that we’d get along just as well without
it. But as long as the other fellow does it
I suppose we’ve got to. You look well, Harland.”
Then his smile deepened. “Lucky for you,
though, you’re not in my gang. You’d lose about
ten pounds on a day like this!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess so,” agreed Clem. “Fact is, Mr.
Cade, I’ve been pretty lazy this summer. Played
some tennis and a few games of golf, and that’s
about all.”</p>

<p>“Tennis? Seems to me tennis ought to have
kept you harder than you look.”</p>

<p>“Well, it wasn’t very strenuous, you see.
Mixed doubles usually.”</p>

<p>“He can’t keep away from the girls, Coach,”
interpolated Lowell, shaking his head sadly. “By
the way, Clem here is rooming with that Todd
guy that didn’t R. S. V. P. to our invitation, and
I told him he’d be held accountable for Todd’s
appearance on this here field not later than one
day hence.”</p>

<p>“That so? Good idea. We want all the promising
material we can get, Harland.”</p>

<p>“You think Todd is promising, then, sir?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I’d say so. He gave us a mean
deal last year, and I ought to refuse to have anything
more to do with him, but I can’t afford to
indulge my personal tastes. Todd looked to me
like good material last fall, and I told him that
if he would buckle down and learn the game I
could pretty nearly promise him a job this year.
But he got tired of it and quit in the middle of
the season. An odd chap. Stubborn, too. He
got my goat for fair, and I said some harsh things
to him, but he didn’t seem to mind much. About<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
all I could get him to say was ‘I guess I’d rather
quit.’”</p>

<p>“Well, as I told Woodie, Coach, I’ll speak to
him, but I wouldn’t be surprised if he didn’t
see it.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” said Lowell. “He’s got to see it!
I’ll make his life a burden to him until he does!
You know me, Clem.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, Woodie, I know what a nuisance
you can make of yourself. Go to it, old son.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cade chuckled at Lowell’s look of outrage
and said: “Well, I wouldn’t bother with him too
much. If he doesn’t want to come out after Harland’s
talked with him I guess we’ll be better off
without him. After all, a man’s got to have
some liking for football before he can play it
well.”</p>

<p>Clem, Lowell and Hick Powers went to luncheon
together after practice was over and then repaired
to Lowell’s room in Lykes and lolled about
for an hour or so, by which time the summer-long
peacefulness of the school was at an end.
Taxi-cabs sped, honking, up Meadow street and
swirled into the drive that led along in front of
the dormitories, voices awoke echoes in the corridors,
feet clattered on the stairs, trunks banged
and dust floated in at the window before which
the three boys, divested of coats and collars,
lounged. “The clans gather,” murmured Lowell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
“Another year of beastly grinding begins. Ah,
woe is me!”</p>

<p>Hick Powers, big, homely and good-natured,
chuckled deeply. “Hear him, Clem. The old
four-flusher! Of all the snaps, he’s got it. Four
courses, mind you!”</p>

<p>“How do you get that way?” demanded Lowell
indignantly. “I’m taking six the first half-year!”</p>

<p>“Yeah, four required and two snaps! Bible
History or—or Eskimo Literature, or something!
Gee, it doesn’t take much to get you guys through
your senior year!”</p>

<p>“But think how we worked to get there!”
laughed Clem. “You’re junior, aren’t you,
Hick?”</p>

<p>“Sure! Finest class in school! First in war,
first in peace, first—”</p>

<p>“First at table,” ended Lowell. “What time
is it?”</p>

<p>“Twelve after two,” answered Clem. “Guess
I’d better mosey along and see if Jim Todd’s
arrived.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t go,” protested Lowell. “We’re
just beginning to like you. What time’s he due?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Maybe he won’t get in until
late. I suppose it takes quite a while to get here
from Maine.”</p>

<p>“Sure. Two or three days. You do the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
thousand miles on snowshoes. Then you take a
dog-sled at the trading post—”</p>

<p>“You’re a nut,” laughed Clem. “I’m sorry
for you, Hick. How do you think you’re going
to get through nearly nine months with him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he won’t get funny with me,” answered
Hick comfortably. “I’ll give him a paddling
every now and then. I’ll make a new man of
him by Spring.”</p>

<p>“You, you big flat tire!” responded Lowell.
“It would take three like you to paddle me! If
it wasn’t so hot I’d box your ears for making a
crack like that right in front of visitors!”</p>

<p>Clem’s progress from Lykes to Haylow was retarded
by encounters with several acquaintances,
and once, having passed the corner of his own
building, he spent ten minutes with his arms on
the window-sill of a lower-floor room talking to
the inmates of it. But he reached his corridor
eventually and found the door of Number 15 ajar.
As he had closed it behind him in the morning he
reached the conclusion that Jim had arrived, and
when he had thrust it farther inward and crossed
the threshold he decided that the conclusion was
correct. Then, as the occupant of the room
straightened up from the business of unpacking
a suit-case opened on the window-seat, he was in
doubt for an instant. If this was Jim, what had
happened to him?</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<small>JIM REPORTS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>After they had shaken hands, Clem took a good
look at his new room-mate. The change in Jim’s
appearance was due to two things, he decided.
In the first place, Jim was dressed differently.
He wore trousers of a grayish brown, a white
negligee shirt with a small blue stripe, a semi-soft
collar and a neatly tied dark-blue four-in-hand.
The shoes were brown Oxfords and evidently
new. The coat that matched the trousers
was laid over the back of a chair. That suit,
Clem reflected, had probably cost very little, but
it fitted extremely well and looked well, too.
Then Jim had filled out remarkably. He was still
a long way from stout, but there was flesh enough
now on his tall frame to take away the lanky look
that had been his most striking feature last year.
He seemed to hold himself straighter, too, as
though he had become accustomed to his height,
and to move with far less of awkwardness.</p>

<p>“What have you been doing to yourself?”
asked Clem.</p>

<p>Jim stared questioningly. Apparently he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
not aware of any change, and Clem explained.
“Well, you look twenty pounds heavier, Jim;
maybe more; and—” But he stopped there. To
approve his present attire would be tantamount
to a criticism of his former.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess I am heavier,” replied Jim. “I
got mighty good food up at Blaisdell’s, and a
heap of it; and then I was outdoors most of the
time. Right healthy sort of life, I guess. Didn’t
work hard, either; not really <em>work</em>.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it was pretty good fun,” mused
Clem. “I’d liked to have got up there for a few
days, but it didn’t seem possible.”</p>

<p>“Wish you had. I’d have shown you some real
fishing. Like to fish, Harland?”</p>

<p>“N-no, I don’t believe I do. Maybe because
I’ve never done much. But it sounded pretty
good, what you wrote, and if father hadn’t arranged
a motor trip for the last part of the summer
I think I’d have gone up there for three or
four days.”</p>

<p>“Guess you thought that was pretty cheeky,
that letter of mine,” said Jim consciously.</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” Clem assured him heartily. If
he had, he had forgotten it now. “Awfully glad
to have you, Jim.”</p>

<p>“I hope you mean that.” Jim laughed sheepishly.
“I tried hard to get that letter back after
I’d posted it, but it happened that the fellow who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
carried the mail out got started half an hour
earlier that morning, and I was too late.”</p>

<p>“Glad you were,” said Clem, and meant it.
“Hope you don’t mind having Mart’s things left
around. He thinks now he will come back next
year and finish out.”</p>

<p>Jim looked about the room and shook his head.
“Mighty nice,” he said. “I’ve got a few things
upstairs that I’ll have to move out, but they ain’t
scarcely suitable for here: there’s a cushion and
a couple of pictures and a sort of a thing for
books and two, three little things besides.”</p>

<p>“Bring them down and we’ll look them over,”
said Clem. “What you don’t want to use can go
in your trunk when you send it down to the store-room.
Don’t believe we need any more cushions,
though.” He thought he knew which of the cushions
in Number 29 was Jim’s! “Too much in a
place is worse than too little, eh?”</p>

<p>“I suppose ’tis,” Jim agreed. “This room’s
right pretty now, Harland, and I guess those
things of mine wouldn’t better it none.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to stop calling me ‘Harland’
sooner or later,” said Clem, “so you might as
well start now, Jim.”</p>

<p>Jim nodded. “I was trying to work ’round to
it,” he answered. “Guess I’ll go up and get
those things of mine out of 29.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you a hand,” said Clem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not until late that evening that Clem
found an opportunity to broach the subject of
football. “By the way,” he said, “Lowell Woodruff
was in yesterday. He’s football manager,
you know. Said he’d sent you a call for early
practice and that you hadn’t made a yip.”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s right,” replied Jim. “I found
a letter from him when I got home three days
ago. You see, after I left Blaisdell’s I went over
Moose River way with another fellow for a little
fishing. Got some whopping good trout, too. So
I didn’t get back to Four Lakes until Monday.
Then I didn’t know if I’d ought to answer the
letter or not. He didn’t say to.”</p>

<p>“No, I fancy he expected you’d show up.
Well, there’s no harm done, I guess. Be all right
if you show up to-morrow afternoon.” Clem
spoke with studied carelessness and stooped to
unlace a shoe.</p>

<p>“Show up?” asked Jim. “Where do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“On the field. For practice. You’re going to
play, of course.” This was more an assertion
than a question.</p>

<p>“No,” said Jim, “I tried it last fall and quit.
It takes a lot of a fellow’s time, and then I ain’t—I’m
not much good at it.”</p>

<p>“Well, Jim, you’ll have a lot more time this
year than you had last, you know. And as for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
being good at it, why, Johnny Cade said only this
morning that you looked like promising stuff.
Better think it over.”</p>

<p>“You mean Mr. Cade is looking for me to
play?”</p>

<p>“Of course he is. You see, the team lost a
good many of their best players last June and
Johnny’s pretty anxious to get hold of all the material
he can. I gathered from what Woodie said
that they are looking to you to fit in as a tackle.”</p>

<p>“Tackle? He’s the fellow plays next to the
end, ain’t he? Well, I don’t see what he’d want
me back again for, after the way he laid me out
last year.” Jim chuckled. “Gosh, he ’most tore
the hide off me, Clem!”</p>

<p>“Well, if you ask me, it was sort of cheeky,
throwing him down in the middle of the season,
Jim, and I can’t say I blame him for getting a
bit waxy about it. However, he’s all over that.
He isn’t holding anything against you; I’ll swear
to that; and if you go out you’ll get treated right.
Johnny and Woodie both believe in you as a football
player, Jim.”</p>

<p>“If they do,” laughed Jim in a puzzled way,
“they’ve got more faith than I have. Why,
honest, Clem, I don’t know much about the game,
even after what they showed me last fall, and I
can’t say that I’m keen about it, either. I always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
thought playing games was supposed to be
fun, but I call football mighty hard work!”</p>

<p>“What of it? Aren’t afraid of hard work, are
you? You know, Jim, a fellow has a certain
amount of—of responsibility toward his school.
I mean it’s his duty to do what he can for it, don’t
you see? Now, if you can play football—”</p>

<p>“But I can’t, Clem.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know. Johnny Cade says you
can. Johnny’s a football authority and ought to
know.”</p>

<p>Jim was silent a moment. Then he asked, almost
plaintively: “You want I should play, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, Jim. That is—well, I want you to
do what you want to do. Of course, if you
think—”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you think I ought to,” Jim persisted.
“That’s so, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“I think,” responded Clem judicially, “that as
long as Johnny Cade wants you, and as long as
you have no good reason for not playing, you
ought to try. I don’t want to influence you—”</p>

<p>Clem became aware of Jim’s broad grin and
ran down. Then: “What you laughing at, confound
you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t laughing,” chuckled Jim. “Just smiling
at the way you don’t want to influence me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, suppose I do?” asked Clem, smiling too.
“It’s for the good of the football team, Jim.
And, if you must have the whole truth, I promised
Woodie I’d talk to you. And I have. And
now it’s up to you. You do just as you please.
Guess you know best, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe I haven’t got any good reason
for not playing this year, or trying to,” mused
Jim, enveloping himself in an enormous nightshirt.
“I don’t think I’ll ever make a good football
player, but if those folks want I should try,
and you want I should—”</p>

<p>“Hang it, Jim, don’t drag me into it! I’d feel
to blame every time you got a bloody nose!”</p>

<p>“—I don’t mind doing it,” concluded Jim.
“Last year it didn’t seem like I was really needed
out there. Maybe this year it will be different.
Maybe Mr. Cade can make me into a tackle. If
he can he’s welcome. Maybe after I’ve been at
it a while I’ll get to like it. Maybe—”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’ll put out that light and go to
bed,” said Clem. “Of course you’ll like it.
You’ll be crazy about it after a week or two, or
a month or two, or—”</p>

<p>“Well, if I got so I could really play,” said
Jim musingly, as the light went out, “maybe I
would. You can’t tell.”</p>

<p>The next afternoon, having resurrected the
football togs he had worn the season before, Jim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
went dutifully over to the field and stood around
amongst a steadily growing gathering of old and
new candidates. He found several fellows that
he knew well enough to talk to, but, having arrived
early, much of his time was spent in looking
on. He observed the coming of Peter, preceded
by a wheelbarrow laden high with necessities
of the game, the subsequent appearance of
Manager Woodruff and Assistant Manager Barr,
the latter apparently weighted down with the
cares of all the world, and then the arrival of
Coach Cade, in company with Captain Gus Fingal.
By that time fully sixty candidates were on
hand and balls were beginning to hurtle around.
Formalities were dispensed with to-day. Mr.
Cade clapped his hands briskly and announced:
“Give your names to Mr. Woodruff or Mr. Barr,
fellows, and hustle it up. Men reporting for the
first time will start to work on the other gridiron.
Last-year fellows report to Captain Fingal here.
Let’s get going, Mr. Manager!”</p>

<p>Jim gave his name and other data to Johnny
Barr and went across to the second team field.
No one seemed interested in his presence there,
and he stood around a while longer. Eventually
the new candidates stopped coming, and Latham,
a substitute quarter-back of last season, took
them in charge. Jim went through just such a
program as had engaged him a year ago. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
afternoon, while not so hot as yesterday, was far
too warm for comfort, and the work was a whole
lot like drudgery. He caught balls and passed
them, chased them and fell on them, awkwardly
rolling around the turf, made frantic and generally
unsuccessful grabs at them as Latham sent
them bouncing away, and then, after a few minutes
of rest, started all over again. At four-thirty
he trotted two laps of the field, keeping,
by injunction, close to the edge of the cinder
track.</p>

<p>Save that he “weighed in” on the gymnasium
scales the next afternoon, while the worried looking
Johnny Barr set the figures down against his
name, Saturday’s program was just like Friday’s.
He wasn’t quite so stiff Saturday night, though,
as he had been after the first session. Clem,
feeling responsibility in the matter, asked how
he had got along. Jim said: “All right, I guess.”
That’s about all he did say regarding his football
experiences for the next week. He had bought
a book of rules, and Clem observed that every
evening he spent a matter of ten or fifteen minutes
on it. Once or twice he invited Clem’s aid,
but Clem wasn’t much use to him.</p>

<p>“You know,” said Clem one evening, “you
don’t really have to know the rules by heart, Jim.
You’re not going to referee; you’re just going to
play the game.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“I sort of like to know what it’s all about,
though,” said Jim. “And maybe,” he added,
with a twinkle, “if the referee made a mistake
I’d want to be able to tell him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’d try it,” scoffed Clem, who hadn’t
seen the twinkle. “You’d make a big hit all
around!”</p>

<p>He was “duck walking” and pushing the charging
machine these days, for he was listed as a
lineman. And he was having his six goes regularly
at the tackling dummy, besides. His education
was branching out. Perhaps because he had
been through the work last year he made steady
progress, although he was lacking in the experience
of those of his companions who had played
football since they were twelve years old. At
tackling he was good, and he got praise more
than once; and he was learning to handle a ball
in a safe, clean fashion, no longer treating it as
if it were an egg that might break if he was rude
to it. At the end of the first fortnight he was
as good a football man as some twenty others on
the field and better than perhaps ten more. As
that particular ten ceased their connection with
football shortly after the Banning High game,
Jim was left for a space superior to none.</p>

<p>So far, save for a word in passing, he had held
no communication with Coach Cade, and if that
gentleman felt any satisfaction over Jim’s presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
among the players he disguised it perfectly.
Not that Jim had expected any expression of
gratitude, of course, but it was difficult to reconcile
Clem’s statement on that first night of the
term with the coach’s apparent complete indifference.
Clem had declared that Mr. Cade was
anxious to have Jim report. And since he had
reported, Mr. Cade had never even noticed him.
Jim reached the not unnatural conclusion that
Clem had slightly exaggerated the coach’s concern.</p>

<p>Lowell Woodruff, though, fully atoned for any
inattention on the coach’s part. Lowell assured
Jim more than once that he fully appreciated the
latter’s presence among the candidates, and he
was almost embarrassingly solicitous as to his
welfare. In fact, his efforts to keep Jim contented
with his lot were so painstaking that Jim
got it into his head that the manager was making
fun of him, and he took a mild dislike to the well-meaning
Lowell. As he made no mention of the
matter to Clem, the misunderstanding existed well
into the season.</p>

<p>Alton played the local high school team, winning
by 21 to 7 in a long and uninteresting contest,
and defeated Banning High School a week
later by 17 to 0. Jim watched both contests from
the bench and added considerably to his knowledge
of the science in which he was a beginner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
But neither game produced any thrilling moments,
and Jim continued unmoved in his opinion
that football was rather an uninteresting pursuit
and certainly not deserving of all the time and attention
given it. Then, after a week of practice
that made the preceding fortnight seem in retrospect
a period of languid idleness, Lorimer Academy
visited Alton, and Jim’s conviction was
slightly shaken.</p>

<p>Lorimer always gave a scrappy argument. In
fact, she had on one occasion argued so well that
a tie score had resulted. This year she looked
better than usual when she went onto the field
for practice, and there were those on the stands
who, perhaps naturally pessimistic, shook their
heads and predicted a defeat for the Gray-and-Gold.
They had reason on their side, too, for
Lorimer was known to have a practically veteran
team while Alton’s team was still in the throes
of constructing itself around no more than four
proven warriors. And the visitors had superior
weight in both line and backfield, although the
superiority was not vast. So the pessimists had
plenty of arguments with which to support their
dismal prophecies.</p>

<p>Coach Cade put his best foot forward when the
game started, using the best material he had in
the hope of getting a safe lead in the first half.
After that he could use his substitutes with discrimination
and, he believed, hold the enemy at
bay. But the safe lead didn’t materialize according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
to his program. Gains through the Lorimer
line were few and difficult to make, and before
the game was ten minutes old it was apparent
that, with the few plays Alton had at present, she
was going to be hard put to score unless the
breaks came her way. In the first period the
only break came when Lorimer blocked Steve
Whittier’s try at a field goal on her thirty-three
yards and a Lorimer tackle scooped up the
trickling ball and sped to Alton’s twenty-seven
yards before he was brought down from behind
by Billy Frost. It looked very much like a Lorimer
score just then, and when the enemy had
tossed a forward pass across the center of the
line for six yards more it looked vastly more like
it. It took Lorimer the next three downs to get
the rest of her distance and fetch up just inside
the seventeen. Doubtless the pessimists were
gloomily happy then. But Lorimer didn’t have
the punch to score, for, after one smash at left
tackle had been stopped, an end run had lost half
a yard and a forward pass had grounded near
the side-line, her try for a goal from near the
twenty-five-yard line failed.</p>

<p>Alton had some success with a full-back run
from kick-formation, Crumb carrying the ball,
and got off one forward-pass of twenty yards,
Crumb to Kinsey, and worked the pigskin back
to mid-field and then into Lorimer territory. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the invasion petered out in a punt that the Lorimer
quarter-back took on his five-yard-line and
laid down finally on his thirty-one. The Lorimer
rooters thought well of that incident and let the
fact be known. Alton displayed scarcely any
signs of delight. That ended the first ten-minute
quarter.</p>

<p>As if to play even, Fortune favored the home
team soon after the second period began by giving
her a chance to score when Billy Frost poked
his way outside tackle and got free for a thirty-eight-yard
scamper that put the ball down on the
adversary’s twenty-six. Crumb hit the right of
center for two and got three more outside tackle.
Billy Frost tried the left end, was thrown for
no gain, and Steve Whittier dropped back to the
thirty while Quarter-back Kinsey knelt on the
turf in front of him and held his hands out for
the ball. Alton was all ready to burst into triumphant
cheers, for Steve was a good place-kicker,
and the ball was directly in front of the goal.
But Alton was reckoning without Mr. Loring
Cheswick, center. Loring set himself firmly and
carefully, measured distance and noted direction
and then sped the ball a foot above Pep’s reach!</p>

<p>So that ended that incident, except that Steve
did all that was humanly possible by chasing the
bounding pigskin back to the forty-yard line,
gathering it up expeditiously and doubling back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
toward the Lorimer goal. But the best he could
do was to reach the thirty-four, close to the side-line,
where he was pulled to earth by no fewer
than three of the enemy. Alton seemed discouraged
and Pep’s choice of plays was not of the
best. A plunge on the short side of the field
netted but a scant yard and didn’t take the runner
over the side-line. Pep’s own run to the left
almost centered the ball but lost the first gain and
two yards more. A fake kick from placement,
which fooled nobody, gave Crumb four yards
through center, and after a conference that was
rudely interrupted by the referee, Whittier
punted to Lorimer’s three yards.</p>

<p>Lorimer kicked promptly and got distance, and
Pep was downed where he caught. On the first
play Levering, at left end, was caught off-side,
and Alton was set back to the forty-seven yards.
Two downs failed to gain, and Alton punted again.
This time Pep got height but not much more and
the ball was Lorimer’s on her thirty-one when
the catcher was stopped. It was there and then
that the visitor began a march up the field that
would not be denied. Three first downs brought
her to Alton’s thirty-seven. Coach Cade sent in
fresh linemen to the number of three and for a
moment the advance faltered. Then a forward-pass
gathered in eight yards and a plunge at
center brought another first down. Progress was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
slower but still apparently sure, and Lorimer
reached the sixteen in four plays. There, however,
with the time-keeper hovering fatefully
near, Alton dug her cleats and spoiled two attempts
at her line. From the fourteen yards
Lorimer brought off a tricky forward-pass that
was shot across the goal-line from behind a wall
of moving interference. That pass failed badly,
though, for the receiver was not in position, and
after the ball had been juggled by two Alton backs
it grounded. Had Lorimer fulfilled the expectations
of the audience she might have ended the
first half with a three-point lead, for it was only
reasonable to suppose that a try-at-goal from the
twenty-four yards would succeed. But Lorimer,
perhaps reasoning that her opponent was certain
to score before the game was over, in which case
three points would not be sufficient for a victory,
decided on all or nothing. With eight yards
needed for a first down she set the stage for a
drop-kick and then shot her quarter-back on a
wide run behind good interference. For a moment
it looked as if she was going to get what
she was after, for when the quarter turned in he
went romping straight for the goal-line, threw off
two tacklers and seemed safe for a touch-down.
But Hick Powers saved the day for the Gray-and-Gold,
plunging into the runner and lifting him
back into a fighting mêlée. The referee whistled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and dug his heel into the five-yard line, and then,
after a look at the rods, waved his hand up the
field. Alton shouted relief and triumph. After
Whittier had punted from behind his line the half
ended.</p>

<p>Jim went back to the gymnasium with the rest
of the squad, feeling for almost the first time
that perhaps football did, after all, hold compensations
for all the drudgery and hard knocks entailed;
that is, if you were on the field instead
of the bench! He began to wonder what his
chances were of ever taking a hand in a real contest,
and what he could do to better them.</p>

<p>Mr. Cade’s talk before the players took the
field again was brief and energetic. Jim, listening
attentively from the outer edge of the circle,
had lost his unsympathetic attitude. There was
sense in what Johnny was telling them, and reason.
After all, it <em>did</em> seem necessary to lick Lorimer,
and, if you granted that, then there was
excuse enough for all this intensity of purpose.
Jim added his own voice to the cheer that followed
the coach’s final grim, “Let’s go get
’em!”</p>

<p>There were changes in the line-up of each team
when the ball was kicked off again, but Alton
presented more new faces than did her opponent.
There were new men in the line and two new men
behind it. One of these was Latham at quarter-back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Latham proved good medicine while he
stayed in, for Alton worked faster and with more
vim than in the first half. Yet for seven minutes
of the ten neither team threatened. Then a
fumbled punt was recovered by Levering on
Lorimer’s thirty-three yards and suddenly the
Gray-and-Gold visioned success and went after
it hard. Crumb, who had borne a great deal of
the work in the first two periods and had been
taken out to rest, was hurried back and celebrated
his return with a fine off-tackle charge that took
the ball to the twenty-six. Latham gained a yard
straight through center and Crumb made it first
down on the enemy’s twenty-two.</p>

<p>An end run put away a scant two, and Frost
was stopped trying to get inside right tackle.
Steve Whittier went back to the thirty-three
yards as though to try a goal, but the ball went
to Crumb and the full-back got another two
through right guard. With six to go on fourth
down a field-goal seemed the only hope, for
Alton’s passing game was still undeveloped, and
when Steve again went back the eyes of the Lorimer
sympathizers sought the cross-bar. But
Steve didn’t kick the ball when he got it. He
lifted it in his right hand and stepped back and
out to the left. Then he shot it diagonally across
toward the right-hand corner of the field, where
Levering was speeding toward the goal-line. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
right end looked over his shoulder, stopped
abruptly, letting a Lorimer back go past, and
pulled the pass out of the air on the seven yards.
He made the four before he was forced over the
side-line. When the ball had been brought in
and a winded Lorimer man had been administered
to, Crumb tried the right of center and made a
scant yard. Pandemonium reigned in the stands.
Latham tried to knife himself through center and
added part of a second yard. Crumb again went
straight at center. It seemed that Alton was determined
to make that score there or not at all.
The linesman’s little iron stick moved forward
another two feet. Fourth down and still about
two to go. This time Crumb went back a little
farther from his line, and when, once more, he
took the pass from center he was going hard
when he reached the swaying lines. Playing desperately
but playing low, Lorimer might have
withstood this final attack by the heavy full-back
had he stayed on his feet, but he didn’t. He went
up and over, and although he was soon borne back
again, he had reached the last white line first,
and that long-deferred score had been won at
last!</p>

<p>When the last quarter started, a minute and a
half after Captain Fingal had missed the try-for-point
by inches only, Coach Cade put back
most of his first-string players, and for the succeeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
ten minutes of playing time the Gray-and-Gold
punted on first down as often as the
ball became hers inside her forty-yard line. She
was frankly on the defensive now and sought delay
by all fair means. Twice, early in the period,
Lorimer started an advance by forward-passes
that got no farther than the thirty-five.
The second one ended when Levering intercepted
a long heave and ran it back into enemy territory.
On the whole, that final quarter was all
Alton’s, for the ball reached her territory only
three times and never stayed long. Lorimer’s
passing game failing her, she had little left to
offer, for while her backs could still gain through
the opposing line the gains were too short to
score with.</p>

<p>When the quarter was almost over, Coach Cade
ripped his team apart and put it together again
with many new components. It was risky, but
the results upheld him. Jim Todd, never for an
instant expecting the call to duty, failed to hear
it until a neighbor ejected him from the bench
with a rude hand at the back of his neck. Jim,
blinking, found Coach Cade beckoning. “Go in
at left tackle,” he commanded. “Roice is out.
Report to the referee and don’t speak to another
person until the first play is over. Let’s see
what you can do, Todd. If any one gets through
you you’ll hear from me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Jim tried to remember all those instructions
as he hurried on and concluded that he had probably
missed some of them. Probably he hadn’t,
though, for he fulfilled them all. No one threatened
his position seriously during the remaining
three minutes of actual play. Or, if any one did,
Jim didn’t realize it. Once he got quite a thrill
when a scowling, dirt-smeared face crashed into
his shoulder, and he seized a writhing body and
deposited it back where it had come from, and
once he got a terrific jar when, seeking to tackle
a speeding Lorimer half, he missed badly and
landed, to the best of his knowledge, on the back
of his neck and did a wild and doubtless inelegant
somersault. He felt both hurt and foolish
and wondered for an instant if any one had observed
his humiliation. There was, he concluded,
quite a difference between tackling the dummy
and tackling an enemy runner. He made up his
mind that the next time he would do better. But,
although he ran around a good deal during the
rest of the game, and got slightly winded when
some unknown person butted him in the stomach
with a knee, he had no opportunity to redeem himself
as a tackler. To his surprise, he discovered
that he was considerably excited, so excited, in
fact, that after one play a horn squawked and a
voice that Jim didn’t like at all called: “Alton
left tackle off-side!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“<em>Me?</em>” demanded Jim in tones of outrage.
“Who says so?”</p>

<p>He looked about for some one to discuss it
with, but Pep Kinsey, back at quarter, told him
to shut up and watch what he was doing, and
then Lorimer’s signals came again and he had
to accept the verdict. Fortunately that five-yard
set-back, occurring as it did well inside Lorimer
territory, made no real difference, and after a
Lorimer back had made a desperate effort to skirt
the Alton left end and had been piled on his head
for a scant one-yard gain the game ended.</p>

<p>Going back to the gymnasium, with the lessening
cheers of the Alton supporters in his ears,
Jim tried to convince Charley Levering that some
one had done him a great injustice. But Charley
only grinned and said rudely: “You’re cuckoo,
Todd. You were off-side a yard when the ball
moved.”</p>

<p>“I was?” asked Jim, crestfallen, still incredulous.</p>

<p>“Of course you were. I saw you myself,
didn’t I? You’ve got to be mighty clever to beat
the ball and get away with it nowadays, Todd.
If I were you I’d cut it out.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t mean to! I didn’t know—”</p>

<p>“That’s what we all say,” jeered Levering.
“But all it gets us is five yards—backward!”</p>

<p>Jim was forced to the conclusion that the individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
with the unpleasant voice was probably
right, after all. Jim recalled the fact that at the
moment he had been slightly excited. Maybe he
had started too soon. He wondered if Coach
Cade would hold it against him. He must take
care not to do it again, anyhow!</p>

<p>There was a meeting of the Maine-and-Vermont
Club that evening and Jim didn’t see Clem to
talk to until bedtime. Then, to Clem’s utter surprise,
Jim began a narrative, a most detailed and
exhaustive story of the last three minutes of the
afternoon’s contest. Jim recounted what he had
done, what he had failed to do, what he had
thought and how he had felt during every one
of the, approximately, six hundred seconds that
he had been on the field. Clem let him run down.
Then he said: “Well, Jim, I’ll say you did mighty
well.”</p>

<p>Jim looked thoughtful while a slow smile encompassed
his features. “Well, I don’t know,”
he answered modestly. “Do you really?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do,” affirmed Clem emphatically.
“Of course, Lorimer was probably pretty well
tuckered out by that time, but, just the same, for
you to keep them from scoring was quite a stunt.”</p>

<p>“Well,” began Jim doubtfully.</p>

<p>“If you’d had any help it would be different,
Jim, but for you, alone and unaided, to do a thing
like you tell about was great!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“Alone?” faltered Jim, puzzled. “I didn’t
say I was alone. Of course I wasn’t alone,
Clem!”</p>

<p>“You weren’t?” Clem registered surprise.
“Oh, my mistake, old son. You see, you didn’t
mention any one else and so I naturally concluded
that—”</p>

<p>“Oh, gosh,” muttered Jim feebly.</p>

<p>“So you had help, eh?”</p>

<p>“For a rotten apple I’d punch your face,” replied
Jim, grinning. “Honest, I didn’t know I
was bragging, Clem!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you were, Jim. I was just having
my little joke. Anyway, for a chap who
couldn’t see football at all a couple of weeks ago
you seem to be at least faintly interested in it!”</p>

<p>“I guess,” said Jim thoughtfully, “I’m going
to like it!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>JIM BUYS A FOOTBALL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>As a room-mate Jim was, Clem soon decided, a
very satisfactory chap. They got on together excellently.
Jim was not monotonous as a companion,
for while he might fairly be termed even
tempered you couldn’t call him good-natured in
the popular meaning of the term. If you expected
to put anything over on Jim, relying on
his good nature to get away with it, you were in
for a surprise. Clem realized that without a
demonstration. Jim would take a joke perfectly,
but he had a sense of dignity that prohibited liberties.
That he was capable of temper Clem
didn’t doubt, although he held it well under
control.</p>

<p>When Jim had declared in his letter to Clem
that he was “neat about the place” he had, Clem
soon decided, stated less than the facts. Clem
himself was certainly not untidy, but his idea of
neatness and Jim’s were wide apart. Jim looked
after his part of Number 15 so carefully and
minutely that Clem’s half of the room suffered
badly by comparison. Clem said once: “You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
aren’t neat, Jim, you’re finnicky!” For a fortnight
Clem really suffered from such excess of
tidiness, for quite unconsciously Jim’s attentions
were extended to his room-mate’s territory and
the book tossed on the table in the morning had
mysteriously disappeared by afternoon, to be discovered,
after patient search, neatly hidden under
a pile of others. If he left his cap on his bed,
half an hour later it was gone. At first he used
to look on the floor for it and under the bed.
Later he learned to go directly to his closet and
take it down from a hook. The second time this
experience fell to him he said: “Hang it all, Jim,
what’s the idea? Here it is in the closet. You
must have put it there. I know I didn’t!”</p>

<p>“Really?” asked Jim, surprised. “I don’t remember
touching it. I’m awfully sorry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right,” answered Clem, “but do
you know what I think? I think you must have
been born in a filing cabinet!”</p>

<p>Jim looked slightly blank, and Clem went out
without elucidating.</p>

<p>After some two weeks of life in Number 15
with Jim, Clem caught the habit. He never attained
to such perfection of orderliness as the
other’s, and doubtless to the end of their days
together Jim secretly considered Clem just a
trifle careless about the room, but, just as evidence
of how thoroughly he had fallen under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Jim’s spell, he once, having reached the door on
his way to chapel, returned the length of the room
to place his slippers more perfectly in alignment
under the head of the bed. It is doubtful, however,
if Jim would have given him any credit for
that. Jim would have kept his slippers, had he
owned a pair, in his closet!</p>

<p>At the beginning of the term the two were not
together a great deal outside of sleeping and
study hours. Jim foregathered frequently with
certain members of the Maine-and-Vermont Club
and Clem’s acquaintances were not yet Jim’s.
They might have been, for Clem suggested more
than once that his room-mate accompany him on
his social excursions. But Jim invariably had an
excuse. The latter did meet two or three of
Clem’s circle of intimates, but the meetings were
only casual. The school year was a fortnight old
when Jim first blossomed out in society.</p>

<p>The occasion was a birthday party given by
Arthur Landorf to Arthur Landorf and some
of Arthur Landorf’s friends. Much assistance,
however, was provided by Art’s parents, for they
had sent a box holding practically all the requirements
of a birthday celebration, including a
frosted cake with seventeen pink candles. The
affair was held in Number 20 Lykes, which room
Art shared with Larry Adams. Art was a hockey
and baseball man and Larry a member of the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
eleven. When Art invited Clem he added:
“And bring your room-mate, whatever his name
is, if he cares to come.” So Clem delivered the
invitation to Jim and Jim started to find an excuse,
as usual. But Clem was fed up by now.</p>

<p>“Stop it!” he said sternly. “I don’t give a
continental if you’ve got a dinner engagement
with Doctor Maitland himself and are down to
address the faculty afterwards! You’re going
with me to Art’s blow-out and you might just as
well make up your mind to it. Say, what’s the
colossal idea, anyhow? Aren’t my associates
good enough for you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t like to butt in on that crowd,”
said Jim. “I ain’t their sort, Clem. I—I
haven’t got any parlor tricks.”</p>

<p>“Parlor tricks! Who’s asking you to do tricks?
You can sit on a chair or a bed or something
without falling off, can’t you? And you can say
‘Thank you’ when some one shoves a hunk of
cake at you, I suppose. Well, that’s all you have
to do, you big lummox.”</p>

<p>“We-ell, if you think I won’t be in the way,”
said Jim dubiously, “and this fellow really said
to ask me—”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up,” grumbled Clem. “Would I be
asking you if he didn’t? Thursday night, old
son, and don’t forget.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’ll be all,” declared Clem. “It’s settled.”</p>

<p>So Jim went along, somewhat subdued at first
and hanging back when they reached Number 20
Lykes, from beyond the closed door of which
sounds of merriment issued. But Clem herded
him inside and shut off escape, and then Jim was
shaking hands with Art and assuring him that he
was “glad to make his acquaintance.” Whereupon,
Art, not to be outdone, replied gravely:
“The pleasure is all mine, Mr. Todd,” and Jim
made his way through a sea of protruding legs
to a seat in a far corner, fortunately not observing
the smiles that followed his progress. To his
relief, he presently discovered that he knew three
of the party, at least to speak to: Lowell Woodruff
and Hick Powers and Larry Adams. The
gathering was presently completed by the arrival
of Gus Fingal and George Imbrie, the latter
editor-in-chief of the school weekly, <cite>The Doubleay</cite>.
The two were amusingly unalike, for Imbrie’s
short, slim form reached only to the football captain’s
shoulder, and whereas Gus’s big, square
head was radiant with tow-colored hair that
looked almost silvery in the light, Imbrie’s was
clad in very dark locks slicked smoothly away
from a pale, intellectual forehead. Imbrie wore
tortoise-shell “cheaters,” although it was rumored
that they were only for effect and aided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
his sight no more than Harold Lloyd’s aided his!
With the arrival of the last guests the proceedings
opened officially. That is, Art turned off the
electric light, switched aside a newspaper that
had covered the birthday cake and applied a
match to the seventeen little pink candles. Loud
applause followed and then, at a signal from
Larry Adams, Art tried to blow out the candles
in one mighty breath and failed because Gus
slammed him between the shoulders just then.
After that the cake was cut—with a clasp-knife
for want of anything better—and the feast began.</p>

<p>Some hosts might have kept the cake until
toward the end of the repast, but Art said it didn’t
seem to him to matter whether you ate your cake
first or last, just so you got it, and so it was devoured
right along with the sandwiches and
pickles and olives and ginger cookies and sweet
chocolate and all the other delicacies. Of the
gathering, however, four were out of luck, for although
the football candidates at Alton were allowed
more leeway in the matter of diet than before
the days of Coach Cade, sweets were not in
great favor, and so Jim, who, while not at the
training table, was still bound in honor to observe
training table rules, and Captain Gus and
Powers and Adams had to be content with homeopathic
portions of cake and to confine the balance
of their menu to the sandwiches and olives. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
there was plenty of tepid gingerale and they fared
well enough.</p>

<p>Lowell Woodruff found a place next to Jim
when the party reseated itself and did his best
to be agreeable. Jim, however, still viewed him
with suspicion and the conversation didn’t become
animated, and after a while Lowell gave up and
turned to his neighbor on the other side. On the
whole, Jim didn’t have a very happy time at that
party. Clem was separated from him by the
width of the room and hidden for the most of
the time by the table, and Jim felt rather out of
it. He was glad when Gus Fingal’s departure
broke up the gathering. He tried to tell his host
politely that he had enjoyed his party, but was
saved from the untruth when one of the others
pushed him outside. In the jostling and confusion
he got away without a word to Art. Returning
to the next dormitory, Clem did all the talking.
Perhaps it didn’t occur to him to ask if
Jim had had a good time. At all events, he
didn’t ask, and Jim was glad of it. Jim was a
poor liar, and knew it.</p>

<p>That ended Jim’s social activities for some
time. There were no more birthday parties
among Clem’s friends, but Clem tried on several
occasions to get Jim to accompany him on visits
to other rooms, and Jim thanked him and declined
firmly. Clem called him a hermit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Following the Lorimer game Jim’s services
were called on daily. Sometimes he got into the
scrimmage for only a handful of minutes, infrequently
he worked through a whole period. He
had survived the second and last cut and had
taken his place on the squad as a second-string
tackle. There was even the possibility, indeed
the probability, of getting into the Kenly Hall
game, for the roster of tackles included only three
others: Roice, Sawyer and Mulford. Jim was
the least experienced of the lot, and at this stage
he knew perfectly well that so far as playing ability
went he was a bad fourth. But he had hopes
of becoming as good as Mulford, at least. In
more optimistic moments he even saw himself
rivaling Willard Sawyer, who was the present incumbent
of the right tackle position. What
he couldn’t imagine was ever equaling Roice.
“Rolls” was almost the best lineman on the team.
Only Captain Fingal was graded above him by
popular opinion.</p>

<p>Jim had not only held the weight he had
brought back with him but had added three
pounds to it, and while, later on, he frequently
dropped those three during a hard afternoon, he
always found them again. Had Jim been more
experienced he might well have wondered sometimes
at being retained on the squad. He had
played football but three weeks or so before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
present season and had not during those three
weeks shown much ability. He was at least six
pounds lighter than the position called for, since
Alton always presented a heavy line. In general
appearance, he did not suggest the ideal tackle.
But Jim had seen little football and so it didn’t
occur to him that there was anything unusual in
his choice as a tackle. Not a few amateur critics,
however, declared that Todd might be end material
but would never be of any value as a tackle.
He didn’t have enough weight, they said, and
what he had wasn’t distributed properly. Besides,
who was he, anyway, and what had he ever
done to get where he was?</p>

<p>But Coach Cade wasn’t making a very great
mistake. If Jim was somewhat lacking in weight—he
was nine pounds lighter than Rolls Roice,
for instance—he possessed two other of the necessary
qualifications of a good tackle, and might
later show that he had a third. Weight he lacked,
mental ability he had not shown, but physical
speed and stamina he did have. He was fast developing
into the speediest candidate for his position,
and Coach Cade, who held speed in the
deepest reverence, was ready to forgive him many
shortcomings. Also, Jim had hard muscles,
muscles developed in the open air and at a greater
variety of strenuous tasks than most boys know,
and he had endurance. You might tire Jim, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
you couldn’t tire him out. At least, no one ever
had. Jim’s father could tell you of walking sixty
miles between daybreak and sundown in the old
days of logging in Maine; and Jim looked a whole
lot like his father! Coach Cade couldn’t know of
the boy’s stamina yet, but he did suspect it, and
as time went on he was able to indulge in not a
little self-gratulation, which is pleasant even to
a football coach.</p>

<p>Once having become thoroughly interested in
the game, Jim learned about twice as fast as he
had before. At first he accepted instruction without
giving it much thought. Now he sought the
reason for everything he was taught, found it
and understood what he was doing and why. Jim
liked to know the logic of what he undertook. If
he couldn’t discover a reason for doing a thing
he didn’t do it unless some one forced him to.
Then he did it only half-heartedly. His rules
book helped him a lot. There were books that
would have explained many things to him and
saved him much thought, but he didn’t know of
them; and studying things out for himself doubtless
made him remember them better. He amused
Clem about this time—I am speaking of the week
between the Lorimer and Southport games—by
buying a football of his own and keeping it on
the closet shelf. Several times daily he would
take it down and handle it; drop it on the floor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and catch it as it rebounded, place it on the floor
and pick it up with one hand, his long fingers
wrapping themselves about the end like—as Clem
phrased it—a starfish on a quahog. Sometimes
Clem would look up to find Jim with the ball
poised in his right hand as if he meant to hurl
it straight through the window, and always when
he studied his rules book the brown leather
spheroid was in his lap. Clem told him one evening,
in mild protest, that he was sickening.</p>

<p>“You fondle that silly thing like it was a baby!
What’s the idea, Jim?”</p>

<p>“Just want to—to get used to it,” replied Jim.
“Want to know what I can do with it. You see,
shaped like it is, you can’t handle it just like you
can a round ball, Clem.”</p>

<p>“My word! Think of that! And you discovered
that all by yourself, too, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Shut up,” said Jim, grinning. “Say, just
stand over there and toss me a few, will you?”</p>

<p>“Toss you— No, I’ll be switched if I’m going
to turn this room into a gridiron. First thing I
know you’ll be moving the furniture out and kicking
the thing around!”</p>

<p>But he did toss the ball to Jim in the end, and
Jim caught it various ways, studying each way,
while Clem looked on and waited for the return
of the ball with the expression of one humoring
a lunatic. So far as Clem ever discovered that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
ball was never taken out of Number 15, until it
went out for good, but it certainly saw a lot of
handling there!</p>

<p>The Thursday before the Southport game Jim
played a full fifteen minutes against the second
team, and busy, strenuous minutes they were.
He had been tried at left tackle and right tackle,
and had discovered no preference, but to-day he
went in between Smith, substituting Captain Fingal,
and Borden, the regular right end. There
had already been a fifteen-minute scrimmage with
the scrubs, in which the big team had scored a
solitary touchdown, and now the scrubs were aching
for vengeance. Jim had his hands very full
with the opposing guard when the first team had
the ball, for the guard played wide and Jim had
a big stretch of line to cover. But he was fast,
and it soon developed that plays sent through the
right of its own line were netting the first team
more than those on the other side. Jim usually
beat his opponent on starting, and he came up
hard, with his back straight and a lot of power in
his charge. He made mistakes still and was
“called down” half a dozen times for one thing
or another. But even the most experienced fared
not much better that day. Twice Jim spilled a
runner behind the line—once, alas, receiving as
his reward harsh words because he should have
gone for the interference instead—and he tackled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
well, using his body and not relying on his arms
alone. On the whole, while he made no spectacular
plays that afternoon, Jim came out of the fifteen-minute
session with his stock higher than it
had been, and when the Alton paper published
the day’s line-up on Saturday morning, the sixth
line read: “Sawyer or Todd.” But then, a hard
game was not looked for and Coach Cade had
planned to use several substitutes at the start.
As it turned out, Jim didn’t get in until the third
period was half over and the game was laid safely
away, the score 26 to 9. But he showed up rather
well while he played, which was until he got a
wrenched knee a scant three minutes before the
end, and emerged with a nickname. When he
came off, limping, some sympathetic freshman
shouted, “Atta boy, Slim!” And “Slim” Todd
it was thereafter.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>EXPERTS IN CONFERENCE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>There was no work on Monday for those who
had taken part in the Southport game. Even
Jim, although he had contributed but some fifteen
minutes of his time to the contest, was excused.
The victory had been an easy one, but it
had nevertheless cost Alton heavily, since four
of the first and second-string men had met with
injuries. Only Crumb had fared seriously, however,
and not for several days was the full extent
of his injury known to the school at large. Then
it was learned that he had fractured some bone
with an unpronounceable name, located in his left
leg, and would be out of the game for some time.
In fact, whether he could get around again in time
for the Kenly game was problematic. This news
was received with consternation, for Crumb had
shown himself the best ground-gainer in the Gray-and-Gold
backfield, the only one, indeed, who
could be relied on for heavy line-smashes to produce
short but certain gains. Weight, speed and
fight made him an ideal full-back, and his loss,
even if it proved only temporary, was going to
be keenly felt. Tennyson, who must fill his shoes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
was twelve pounds lighter and was an almost unknown
quantity as yet. He had shown ability in
practice and in the first two games, but had not
played against Lorimer, nor against Southport
until the last quarter was well along. However
well he might develop, it seemed certain that he
would never show either the power or the ding-dong
fighting spirit that had made Tom Crumb’s
work notable.</p>

<p>Jim’s knee responded readily to treatment, and
he could have stood the gaff on Monday had he
been allowed to, which he wasn’t. All he could
do was go to the field and watch the first team
substitutes practice and, later, get mauled about
by the second. The only incident of interest to
Jim occurred when Manager Woodruff found him
on the stand and announced: “Todd, you’re to
join the training table to-night.”</p>

<p>Jim blinked and considered. Then, “Well, I
don’t know, Woodruff,” he said slowly. “I guess
I’d just as lief not.”</p>

<p>“You—what?” gasped Lowell.</p>

<p>“Well, you see I’m getting on right well where
I am, and I’m sort of used to the fellows.”</p>

<p>“You’re a queer guy,” said Lowell, feelingly.
“Don’t you know that any other fellow would be
tickled to death to be taken on?”</p>

<p>Jim pondered that. “No, I didn’t know,” he
acknowledged finally. “Anyhow, I don’t really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
care two cents about it, and if there’s some one
else that would like it—”</p>

<p>“Can’t be done, Todd,” Lowell grinned. “Mr.
Cade’s set his heart on you.”</p>

<p>“He says I’m to go?” asked Jim with more
animation.</p>

<p>“He sure does. Them’s his orders, Todd.
Show up this evening, eh?”</p>

<p>“Of course. I didn’t quite understand. Much
obliged.”</p>

<p>“Quite welcome. Say, you’re getting along
pretty well, aren’t you. How’s the ankle, by the
way?”</p>

<p>“Ankle? Oh, it was my knee. It’s all right.
Say, I guess maybe I acted sort of sour the other
night.”</p>

<p>“What night was that?” asked Lowell.</p>

<p>“Up in that fellow’s room. What’s his name?
The fellow who had the birthday cake. Yes, Landorf.
Well, I guess I seemed like I didn’t want
to talk.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I did get some such impression,
Todd, but it was your say. If I didn’t want to
talk, I wouldn’t. But I always do!”</p>

<p>“Well, it was like this.” Jim frowned slightly
in the effort to explain. “I sort of thought you
were kidding me.”</p>

<p>“Kidding you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, before that. Right along. You were always
sort of telling me that I was getting on
great, and things like that.”</p>

<p>“Well, Great Scott, so you were!”</p>

<p>“Maybe I was. I didn’t know. It didn’t seem
so to me, anyhow. Seemed to me I was pretty
stupid. And I thought you were sort of having
a joke with me. I didn’t mind, exactly, only—
Well, maybe I did mind a little.”</p>

<p>“But I wasn’t joking, Todd. I—look here, I’ll
be honest. Remember how you up and flew the
coop last Fall? That was Dolf Chapin’s fault.
You needed a bit of patting on the back and encouragement
to make you stick. He didn’t see
it. So you got it into your head that nobody
loved you and your pie was all crust. Well, I
didn’t want it to happen again like that this year.
Why, bless your dear heart, sonny, I’ve watched
you the way a fond mother watches her favorite
kid. Every time I’ve seen you sitting down there
on the bench looking kind of lonesome I’ve had
heart failure. I wanted to go over and tell you
funny stories and sing songs and do tricks to
bring the light of happiness back to your sad eyes!
I dare say I sounded like a silly ass sometimes
when I tried to cheer you up, but that was because
you aren’t what I’d call responsive, Todd,
and I always had the feeling that you thought I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
was a blamed pest. You know, anything like that
does kind of take the zest from a chap’s conversation!”</p>

<p>Jim was smiling, and as Lowell paused he
chuckled and said: “Gosh, I thought all the time
that you thought I was rotten and didn’t know
it, and were just having fun seeing how much
I’d swallow! Say, I hope you’ll excuse me,
Woodruff.”</p>

<p>“Sure will! Anyway, I fancy it was my—well—method
of approach that was at fault. I was
so gol-derned anxious to make you one of our
happy little family so you wouldn’t jump the
traces again that—well, I guess I was <em>too</em> anxious!
Believe me, though, I wasn’t making fun of you,
Todd. Wouldn’t have had a chance, anyway.
Why, hang it, you’ve made more progress than
any geezer in the bunch! You didn’t know much
football, when you come right down to it, and
you <em>learned</em>. Now you know more than a lot of
the fellows who have been playing for four or
five years.”</p>

<p>“<em>Me?</em>” ejaculated Jim. He looked at Lowell
with something of the old suspicion. But the
manager met his eyes squarely and nodded emphatically.</p>

<p>“You, Todd! Why, you’re coming ahead so
fast that you’ve got Johnny Cade blinking. I
could tell you something that would make you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
open your eyes, but I mustn’t. Well, I’ve got to
be getting back down there and earning my
princely wage. Don’t forget to show up at training
table to-night. I’m responsible for you.”</p>

<p>“I won’t. And—say, I’m glad you really think
I’m getting on. It was right hard at first to get
the hang of things. Maybe I ain’t got the hang
of ’em yet, but I guess I’m some better.”</p>

<p>“Rather! That’s speaking very mildly, too.
See you later!”</p>

<p>Being only human, Jim sat there and basked
in the sunshine of Lowell’s praise for some time.
He had worked hard and faithfully and until now
he had never been assured that he had really won
success. Of course, Clem had spoken encouragingly
many times, but Clem was a friend and no
football man and maybe didn’t know. Lowell
Woodruff was different. Lowell knew football
and football players and he was on the inside.
Jim hugged his knees and felt that life was a
very satisfactory affair. And then, when practice
was over, he followed the players back to
the gymnasium, realized that he had no reason
for going inside and so wandered across the
campus and through State street and at the next
corner met with an encounter that caused him to
reconsider his opinion of life.</p>

<p>There was a conference in Coach Cade’s quarters
that Monday evening. The coach occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
rooms in the old-fashioned white house at the
corner of Academy and State streets, opposite
the main gate to the campus. His living-room
was a comfortable place of faded carpet and old
walnut furniture brightened by such modern
things as a handsome electric lamp on the big
round table, a steel filing cabinet and many books
and magazines littering the apartment. To-night
were present the host himself, Captain Gus Fingal,
Lowell Woodruff, Johnny Barr, Pep Kinsey,
Steve Whittier, Rolls Roice, Billy Frost and
Charley Levering. Coach Cade, seated by the
table, held several sheets of paper in one hand
and a briar pipe in the other. The visitors sat
around the table or adjacent to it and were respectfully
attentive to the coach’s words.</p>

<p>“I thought,” Mr. Cade was saying in his quiet,
pleasant voice, “it was about time for some of
us to get together and look over the ground. I
asked two or three more to be present to-night,
but I don’t see them. Perhaps they’ll show up
later.”</p>

<p>“My fault, Coach,” said Lowell. “I couldn’t
get in touch with them in time.”</p>

<p>“Then it wasn’t your fault, Lowell. But there
are enough of us here to discuss things, and a
discussion is about all I had in mind. You see,
fellows, Saturday’s game finished the half-season.
From now on we’ll be pointing to the Kenly game.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
What comes before that must be met as best it
can. Our job now, and it’s a big job, too, is to
build up for Kenly Hall.”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget Mount Millard, Mr. Cade,” said
Billy Frost. “We’ve got to lick them, sir, after
what they did to us last year!”</p>

<p>“We’ll do our best, Frost, but we mustn’t go
out of our way much. So far, we’ve come along
pretty easily, fellows. We’re fairly well grounded
in the rudiments, although there’s still chance for
improvement, of course, and we’ve developed
some team play. Now, however, we’ve got to
consider a plan of campaign. In doing that we
must take into account our own material and
Kenly’s, decide what sort of a game we are best
fitted to play and what style of game we may expect
from the enemy. The one outstanding feature
of our team so far is speed. We’ve shown
more speed than we showed at any time last year,
and I’m convinced that we can show still more.
I like speed, fellows, speed in starting and speed
afterwards. I’ve seen a fast team win from a
team that knew more football and played far
smoother more than once, only because the better
team—better theoretically, that is—lacked
speed. The simplest plays will go well if they
go fast, and the cleverest, most deceptive ones
will fail if they’re run off slow.</p>

<p>“This year we’ve got a fast line and a fast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
backfield. We aren’t quite as heavy in the line
as we were either last year or the year before
that, and we don’t begin to have the weight in
the backfield. But lack of weight can be more
than offset by speed, and so it’s speed and more
speed that we must go after. It’s rather early
to say what we’re to expect from Kenly. She’s
made a good start, but no better than our own,
and hasn’t had to show anything but ordinary
formations and old-stock plays. But we know
that she’s got most of her last year’s line back
again and three or four of the backs that gave
us so much trouble. Her line is heavy and her
backfield’s heavy, and it’s reasonable to suppose
that she’ll build her game on those facts. Kenly
has always favored the line-smashing game and
I’d be surprised if she changed much this year.
However, we’ll know more about that later.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cade studied a paper a moment. “It
comes to this, then,” he resumed. “Granted that
Kenly will rely on line bucks and runs outside
tackles for most of her gains, it’s up to us to
build a defense that will meet that style of play.
Weight won’t do it, for she’ll beat us there.
She’ll go through us if we give her the start.
The only way to stop her is to not let her get
started. We must get the jump on her, fellows,
and that means speed. If we can hold her in the
line we can meet her on equal terms in other departments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
I think. We may even have a slight
edge on her when it comes to the kicking game.
What Kenly will bring in the way of forward
passes I can’t say. That, too, is something we’ll
have to get a line on later. But she has never
been dangerous with her overhead stuff. Her
coach has never taken to that style of game much.
But if she does develop a good passing game
we’ve got to meet it with the same stuff, speed.
Speed, then, is going to be the big cry here this
Fall. I want to impress that fact on you here
and now. I want you to go away from here thinking
speed, and I want you to keep right on thinking
it until the last play of the Kenly game is
over.</p>

<p>“Now let’s talk about offense a little. For the
sake of argument, we’ll say that we’ve got the
edge on Kenly for fast playing. We’ll assume
that our line charges quicker than hers, that our
backs get started faster and run faster, that we
pull off our plays and our kicks faster. Now,
then, what sort of an attack are we going to use?
What style of offense are we going to build on?
What do you think, Captain Fingal?”</p>

<p>“If we’re faster than Kenly, and speed makes
up for the difference in weight, we’re starting
even, aren’t we?”</p>

<p>“Possibly, yes. We’ll say so.”</p>

<p>“Then we can play any style there is, can’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
we? I mean, Coach, we stand just as good a
chance of making our line plays good as she does;
and the same with kicks and passes and end
runs.”</p>

<p>“True, assuming that the teams are evenly balanced,
which we are assuming. But what we
want for an attack isn’t something just as good,
Gus, but something better. Now, suppose—”</p>

<p>“I’d say we ought to dope out a passing and
running game, Coach,” broke in Pep Kinsey.
“Something based on speed that might take them
off their feet. Say we had a formation that was
good for a punt or a pass or a run outside tackle.
Then suppose we put a lot of fizz into it and
had them guessing what was coming. If Tom
Crumb’s out of the game we can’t look for a whole
lot against their line between tackles, I guess. I
don’t know how Sam Tennyson will develop, but
he’s light, sir, and the rest of us aren’t whales.
I guess you’ve got the right dope, all right, when
you talk speed!”</p>

<p>“A corking good passing game is our best bet,
Mr. Cade,” offered Levering. “Don’t you think
so, sir?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I think, Levering. I think
whatever we build on that thing’s got to have
speed underneath it. All right. Here’s speed.”
He held a hand out, palm upward. “Now what?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
What shall we put on next for a second story?”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence. Then the quarter-back
spoke eagerly. “Deception!”</p>

<p>“Right! Speed and deception, fellows. That’s
a tough combination to beat. And it’s tougher
than ever if the other fellow is slow in getting
off. Kinsey’s idea of a triple-threat formation
is what I’ve had in mind. That’s what we ought
to have, I’m sure. Last Fall showed me one
thing conclusively, and that is that having more
than two formations, one for kicking and one for
everything else, is a big mistake. You remember
that we changed our backfield all about when we
made a forward-pass. Of course, we did run
from that formation now and then, but the thing
was a give-away, just the same. When Kenly
saw that ‘C Formation’ she knew pretty well what
to expect, and after the first half she looked for
a pass every time and, if I remember correctly,
we made just five out of fourteen attempts. This
year I propose that we find a formation for the
backs that will answer every purpose of attack,
even punting. When we decide on that we’ll
build our plays on the formation instead of suiting
the formation to the plays.”</p>

<p>“That sounds good,” said Gus. “Only I don’t
just see how it’s to be done. If we place our
backs too far behind the line we can’t get them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
through on quick openings. If we put Steve too
close he won’t be able to get punts off before
Kenly gets on top of him.”</p>

<p>“As for the latter,” said Coach Cade, “I don’t
agree. Remember, Gus, we’re building on speed.
If Steve gets his kicks off a bit quicker than he
does now he can kick from nearer the line.”</p>

<p>“Besides,” said Pep, “how is Kenly going to
know that it is a kick if Steve doesn’t go back?
Seems to me that’s the beauty of it. Keep ’em
guessing every minute! Hot stuff!”</p>

<p>“We’ll take up the matter of that formation
later,” said the coach. “Just now there’s another
thing I want to talk about. What kind of
a passing game can we work out? I have my
own idea, but I’d like to hear from you.”</p>

<p>“Whatever it is, it’s got to be a heap better
than last year’s,” said Rolls Roice. “As you
said, Coach, they were looking for our tosses
every time toward the last and they didn’t go
for a hang. If Kenly had had the sense to grab
the ball sometimes instead of knocking it down
she’d have licked us worse than she did.”</p>

<p>“There’s one thing about the passing game,”
said the coach. “If you can’t have a good one
you’re better off with none. And having a good
one isn’t so easy. You can plan it out on paper
so that it looks like a world-beater, but if your
ends and backs can’t reach the ball and handle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
it perfectly, your plan’s a fizzle. You didn’t have
much luck last year, Pep, and neither did Knowles
or Suydman. Catches were mighty few, even
when there was a fair chance. I’m not saying
this in criticism of you, but just to emphasize
the fact that it’s the individual player who counts
in the passing game, and that if we’re to show
anything in that line, anything worth while, we’ve
got to go into the business in real earnest. Half
the value of the forward pass is in keeping the
opponent scared. If you have a passing game
and he knows it, he’s looking for it more than half
the time. But you’ve got to really have something.
If you haven’t, he soon discovers it and
pulls his backfield in. Just as long as you’ve got
the goods, even if you don’t deliver them, he will
play a fifth man back and weaken his line by just
so much. That fifth man is almost invariably the
center, and a quick plunge at the center position
will usually gain. Personally, I think that no
one has yet discovered nearly all the possibilities
of the forward-pass as an offensive play. I believe
that, unless a change in the playing rules
comes that will place restrictions on the pass, another
five years will see the old line-plunging
game subordinated to it. But I’m getting away
from the business of this gathering.</p>

<p>“Suppose you fellows put your minds to work
along the lines suggested this evening. Start<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
with the fact that, no matter what else we have
when we meet Kenly, we’re going to have speed,
and lots of it. Then try to think of the best way
to use that speed on attack. I’ll take care of
using it for defense. Figure out a—let us call
it an all-purpose formation, a formation from
which we can hit the line, run the ends, punt and
pass. It’s possible. I’m not certain that the
Princeton formation doesn’t come pretty close to
it except as to punting. Anyhow, put your minds
to work, fellows, and see what comes of it. We’ll
get together again Wednesday evening here, and
we’ll try to get more of the team on hand. Remind
me about that, Mister Manager, and I’ll tell
you who I want here that evening.”</p>

<p>“Shucks,” said Charley Levering, “I never
could dope out plays. On paper, I mean.”</p>

<p>“As long as you dope them out on the field
we’ll be satisfied,” replied Mr. Cade. “I’m not
looking for plays from you, Levering. We can
find plenty of those when we’re ready for them.
What I want is ideas. You know the team and
you know pretty well what its merits are and
what its faults are. Credit it with speed. You
can do that fairly enough, for I’ll say frankly
that you fellows look mighty good to me at that
angle. Then try to think up the sort of game
we can best play to make full use of that speed.
Never mind trick plays and all that sort of thing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Those will come later. Consider the Kenly game
as a campaign and decide how, if you were the
General in command of our Army, you’d conduct
it. Not as to detail. A General can’t foresee
the skirmishes, sometimes not even the battles.
The best he can do is plan. I’m hoping that some
of you will bring ideas that will help in determining
our campaign. Two heads are better than
one, you know, and so eight ought to be still better.
Now, if any one likes Swiss cheese, made
in Wisconsin, and pilot bread and ginger ale,
we’ll blow the whistle!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>JIM ASKS A LOAN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>On Tuesday all but one of the Alton football
squad reported for practice, the exception being
Greenough, a substitute end, who had sustained a
badly wrenched ankle in the Southport game. To
be exact, there were twenty-nine khaki-trousered
youths on hand when three o’clock struck. Of
this number, nineteen were linemen, one of them
a second team fellow named Cooper who had that
day been snatched to the first as a substitute
guard, that Fillmore might go to the backfield to
understudy Tennyson. To-day new emphasis was
laid on throwing and catching, end, tackle and
backfield candidates to the number of seventeen
being put through a long drill. Subsequently,
during signal work, forward passes were more
frequent than usual. Jim’s knee bothered him at
first, but he speedily forgot about it, and when
the afternoon’s session was at an end it seemed
just as good as ever. The second was cocky that
day and twice held the first inside her five-yard
line, and, since Coach Cade had ruled out field-goals,
there was no scoring until, just before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
end of the second period—two halves of fifteen
minutes constituted the practice game—Plant, at
right half for Billy Frost, got away on his own
twenty-four and raced some seventy-six yards for
a touch-down.</p>

<p>Jim played through all of the last half and
pleased himself thoroughly. Those second-team
fellows weren’t so hard to handle to-day. He had
three men opposed to him while he was in and
none outplayed him in his opinion. To be sure,
no one stopped proceedings to tell him he was
doing well, but Jim had learned that praise, even
commendation, was dealt out sparingly, and that
so long as a player got along without being
scolded it could be assumed that he was performing
very creditably. Although he had been at
training table but two days he found things not
a little different on the field. He was no more
a part of the squad than before, but it seemed
that being taken to the table had served as an
initiation that had admitted him to an inner sanctuary.
Fellows who had never recognized him
three days ago now hailed him as “Slim”—possibly
without always knowing his last name—quite
in the off-hand manner of age-old acquaintances.
At first it embarrassed him greatly, but
he liked it even then. He felt of importance for
the first time since he had begun to play. He
was, at last, somebody in the football world of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Alton! Before, he had thought of himself as
being there on sufferance; now he belonged. The
sense of camaraderie helped a lot, too. Somehow,
now when Pep Kinsey or Latham or Barnhart,
playing quarter, yelped at him for playing
too far in or too far out or, as once happened,
starting before the signal, he didn’t take it to
heart. The quarter was just one of his own
crowd!</p>

<p>It was still light when Jim got back to Haylow
that afternoon, and Clem was sprawled on the
window-seat, reading, his book held close to the
pane. “There’s been a gentleman here to see
you, Jim,” he announced. There was faint emphasis
on the word “gentleman,” and Jim’s
brows contracted as he turned to the closet to
hang up his cap. “Said he’d be back again.”</p>

<p>“What did he look like?” asked Jim soberly.</p>

<p>“Well, to tell you the truth, old son, he looked
rather seedy. Slight chap, about twenty-four,
perhaps. In case he’s a particular friend of
yours, I won’t be too detailed.” Clem grinned.
“Anyhow, he’s coming back, and if I were you,
Jim, I’d pay the bill.”</p>

<p>“What bill?”</p>

<p>“How do I know?” chuckled Clem. “Perhaps
the bill you owe his poor old widowed mother for
the washing. He struck me as the sort of guy
who’d be likely to land you one on the nose if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
you didn’t settle prompt. How did football go?”</p>

<p>“All right.” Jim seemed rather thoughtful.
Instead of sitting down he walked twice between
the window and the door, his hands in his pockets.
Then, “All right,” he said again.</p>

<p>“Still all right, eh?” asked Clem. “That’s
fine. When a thing’s all right I do love to have
it stay that way.” Jim looked at him in puzzlement.
“If it happened to change, you’d let me
know, wouldn’t you?” pursued Clem anxiously.</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” asked Jim,
frowning perplexedly. But he didn’t hear Clem’s
reply, for just then the sound of footsteps in the
corridor caused him to swing expectantly toward
the door. But the steps went by. Clem was still
talking.</p>

<p>“If it’s anything serious, I’ll be glad to help
any way I can. You know that, Jim. I haven’t
much influence with the police, but what I have
will be gladly exerted in your behalf. Perhaps
a confession would ease your mind, old son.
Where and when did the crime take place, and
what motive induced you to kill the beautiful
girl?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” protested
Jim worriedly. “You asked about practice
and I told you—”</p>

<p>“‘All right.’ Quite so. But if ever a fellow
had guilt written all over his phiz, you’re the fellow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Jim. You’ll have to do better than that when
you face the jury!”</p>

<p>Jim managed a laugh. “Oh, I thought you
were talking serious about something.” He sat
down then, but he didn’t relax as he might have
been expected to after as strenuous an afternoon’s
work as he had put in. It became apparent
to Clem that he was really uneasy, and probably
about the visitor.</p>

<p>“If you’d rather not see that chap when he
returns,” said Clem carelessly after a moment’s
silence, “if he does return, I’ll send him away. I
wouldn’t be surprised if he was just some one
trying to sell books or something, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Jim vaguely. “Thanks.” After
a pause he added: “Guess I’d better see him,
though.”</p>

<p>“Have your own way, but you won’t be seeing
much. He struck me as—”</p>

<p>But at that instant there was a knock on the
door, a knock that had been preceded by no warning
footfalls outside. “That’s probably he now,”
said Clem. “Want me to—”</p>

<p>But Jim had sprung up and was already at
the door. He opened it no more than a foot, and
from where Clem sat the visitor was invisible.
“Hello,” said Jim. There was no pleasure in his
voice, and Clem smiled even as his curiosity increased.
There was a subdued response from beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the portal which Clem couldn’t catch, and
then: “But I asked you not to,” said Jim accusingly.
“You ought to do like—” Then Jim
slipped through into the corridor and the door
closed tightly behind him.</p>

<p>Clem pursed his lips and shook his head.
“Now what the dickens?” he asked himself.
“Mystery, by gum! Conspiracy even! And old
Jim acting like the villain in ‘A Guilty Secret’!
What do you know? Gosh, you never can tell
about these innocent-looking chaps. Wonder
what that cheap skate wants with Jim.” No
sound came from the corridor. Probably the
two had moved away from the door. Some five
minutes passed, and Clem, staring into the darkening
world, was watching the campus lights
come on one by one and had forgotten Jim and
his mysterious caller when the door opened once
more.</p>

<p>Jim came in alone, thrusting the door back behind
him. Clem said: “You might switch on the
light if you don’t mind, Jim.” Jim did so, and
the yellow radiance that still showed through the
crack of the door and proclaimed the corridor
lights going, paled. “Well,” continued Clem
gayly, “did you have to pay him hush-money?”
Then he saw Jim’s troubled and embarrassed
countenance and the raillery died out of his voice,
“What’s up?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“Clem, I hate to ask you, but I—” Jim stopped,
gulped and went on. “Can you lend me five dollars,
Clem?”</p>

<p>“Great Scott! Is that all it is?” Clem
laughed with relief as he jumped up. “I thought
murder had been done and you wanted me to help
conceal the body! Five dollars? Ten if you
want it, old son. I happen to be in funds just
now.”</p>

<p>“Five will be plenty,” said Jim in a subdued
tone. “I’ll give it back to you just as soon as I
can, but maybe it won’t be this week, because—”</p>

<p>“There’s no hurry at all, Jim, so don’t be so
down-hearted.” He opened a drawer in his chiffonier,
found a bunch of keys and then went to
his closet. “We will now open the strong-box,”
he continued as he pulled a black leather suit-case
from the shelf. “Say, I hope you aren’t being
blackmailed, old son,” he added, chuckling.</p>

<p>From the suit-case, which apparently held only
a discarded shirt and two ancient tennis balls,
he magically produced a folded envelope. This
he took to the table and opened. From it came
several bills and four gold coins. “You may have
gold if you’d rather,” he laughed. “That’s
Christmas money from last year and the year
before. I’ve got an uncle who always comes
across with two of those, and somehow they never
get spent. I meant to put them in the bank before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
I came back, but forgot it and I found them
in my trunk when I landed. Here you are, old
son. Sure five’s enough? Here’s two more if
you say the word; or you can have one of these
lovely gold coins.”</p>

<p>“This is plenty,” said Jim earnestly, his voice
low. “Thanks, Clem. It’s mighty good of you.”
He disappeared once more and again the door
closed tightly behind him. Clem stared in a
puzzled way, then shrugged his shoulders, returned
the four gold pieces and two crumpled dollar
bills to the old envelope and tossed the latter
back into the bag. Then he turned the key, placed
the suit-case back on the shelf and dropped the
key-ring into the drawer in the chiffonier. When
he had rescued his book from the window-seat
and pulled the curtains across the casements, Jim
had returned to the room. He had paused inside
the door, his back against it, and was staring
thoughtfully at the floor. Then, before Clem
thought of anything to say, he roused himself and
came to the table.</p>

<p>“I guess you’re wondering about—about that
fellow,” he said slowly, “and me lending him
money.”</p>

<p>“Well, curiosity won’t hurt me,” answered
Clem cheerfully. “It’s no affair of mine, Jim,
and you don’t owe any explanations.”</p>

<p>“He’s a fellow I used to know pretty well,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Jim went on. “He—we used to live close together
and he was always mighty good to me
when I was a little codger. He’s been having
trouble lately; out of work and the like of that,
Clem; and he’s sort of lost hold, I guess. I ran
across him yesterday afternoon on State street.
He was looking for me to get a little money to
carry him along. I gave him three dollars and
a half. That’s all I had. That’s why I had to
ask you for that five dollars just now.”</p>

<p>“I see. But that chap doesn’t expect you to
lend him money right along, I hope. Eight dollars
in two days is fairly steep, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Jim nodded. “He said yesterday he was going
to Norwalk. Said he had a job promised him
there. But it seems he didn’t have enough money
left this morning for his ticket. So he wanted
me to lend him some more.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s all right,” said Clem. “Let’s
hope he gets his job. To speak right out in meeting,
Jim, I didn’t like his looks much, and his
hands didn’t seem to me to show many signs of
hard and honest labor. Also, if you’ll pardon me
for seeming disrespect to a friend of yours—or,
let us say, acquaintance—I thought I detected an
aroma about him that—well, it wasn’t exactly the
odor of sanctity, Jim.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I noticed it, too,” replied Jim sadly. “I
guess he’s been sort of up against things and—and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
discouraged, Clem. He’s had no job for more
than a month, he says. But I made him promise
me he’d behave if I let him have that five. And
I guess he will. He used to be such a nice fellow,
Clem!”</p>

<p>“Too bad,” said Clem sympathetically. “Lost
his grip, I suppose. Well, maybe he’ll land on
his feet again. I dare say it’s not any too easy
to keep straight, Jim, when you’re on your uppers.
Don’t you think of paying back that five,
old son, until you get it back from that fellow,
no matter if it’s ten years from now. I don’t
need it.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, but I’d rather pay it as soon as I
get my allowance,” Jim protested. “That’ll be
about ten days from now.”</p>

<p>“You’re a stubborn old Maineiac,” said Clem
sadly, “but have your own way about it. Meanwhile,
has it occurred to you that the time is
twelve minutes past six and that if we want food
we’d better get a move on us? Of course, you,
being on the training table, don’t need to worry
so much, but where I battle for sustenance it’s
a case of first come, first get it! And,” added
Clem, waving a towel as he made for the door,
“there are those at my table who have no conscience
at all where another man’s butter is concerned!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>THE ART OF LINE PLAYING</small></h2>
</div>


<p>On Wednesday a stranger appeared at practice.
He was a large, broad-shouldered man of perhaps
twenty-five or twenty-six years, with a jovial
voice and a pleasant smile. He wore a nondescript
assortment of football togs among which
was a blue sweater bearing a white Y. He did not,
however, retain the sweater long, for five minutes
after practice had started he was down by the
farther goal in charge of a bunch of guards and
tackles. With the sweater he seemed to have discarded
the jovial voice and the pleasant smile.
Presently the rumor spread that the stranger was
one Myers, an Alton guard of some years before
and, more recently, <em>the</em> Myers who had helped
put Yale back on the football map. Also, rumor
had it, he was to remain at Alton until the Kenly
game and take charge of the linemen.</p>

<p>That afternoon Jim added not a little to his
knowledge of playing in the line. Myers spent
much time showing his charges how to stand, both
on attack and defense. After Hick Powers, invited
by the coach to take his position on attack,
had set himself, Myers charged into him and sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
him sprawling on his back. “There you are,”
said Myers. “You were all right for a straight-on
attack, but your feet were too much on a line
for a side-swipe. You can’t always tell how the
other fellow is going to come at you. Try it
again. Spread wider. All right. Hold it! Not
too much weight on your hand, though. Just
steady yourself with your finger-tips. Now you
fellows study that position. You see that this
man is set so that no matter how I may come
at him he’s got stability. This right foot is far
enough behind the left so that I can’t throw him
off his balance by going straight into him, and
far enough to the right so that I can’t throw him
to his left by charging him sidewise. All of you
take that stance. You fourth chap there, bring
that rear foot out more. That’s better. Now
look at your feet and see how you’re standing.
Got it? Good! One thing more before we drop
the attack position. Don’t anchor yourself by
putting your weight on your hands. What you
are doing is taking the position of a sprinter, and
the sprinter doesn’t put the weight of his upper
body on his hands. If he did he’d do one of two
things when the pistol barked; he’d either plunge
forward on his face or he’d have to shift his
weight back to his legs before he left the mark.
You’re using that position because it’s the position
that will get you into play quickest. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
your weight must always be on your feet. Never
use your fingers to more than steady yourself.
Myself, I like to put only one hand to the ground.
I let my left hand point back. It seems to me
that it helps me start. But that’s not important.
Use both hands if it seems better for you. Only,
and I’m repeating this purposely, don’t get anchored.
And when I say put the weight on the
feet, I don’t mean, of course, that you’re to distribute
the weight evenly. The front foot carries
most of the weight. It sets flat on the
ground. The rear foot holds the ground only
with the ball and the toes. But you know that,
even if you don’t know that you know it!”</p>

<p>“Now let’s take the position on defense. The
other side has the ball. Show me now. Not bad,
the most of you. Several of you are too high.
Remember this, fellows. Up and forward is the
direction, not just forward. You must come from
below and push upward first. Then forward.
Up and forward! Remember that. Ever see a
clay pigeon released from a trap? Well, that’s
the way you fellows ought to charge. Just as
though some one had released a spring and sent
you straight and hard into the air. Straddle
well, keep your head up, hold your arms wide
and your hands open and then <em>snap</em>! Don’t go
at it like a crane lifting a block of stone, slow and
steady. Don’t try any tank warfare. Speed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
fellows! Get the jump every time! Drive into
him from below and push him up and back, and
do it before he can throw his weight to meet you.
And when you charge know what you’re going
to do, where you’re going to apply your power.
Be ready with your hands. They’ll get there before
your body. And then don’t stride forward.
Use the short, quick crawling steps you’ve been
taught. Then you’ll get the power from low
down. <em>But</em> if you don’t keep your back straight
that power, originating in your legs, won’t reach
your arms. There’ll be a break in the line of
transmission. Now, then, let’s try it. Set wide
and get steady. Elbows out, hands ready. Go!
Not bad. You fellow with the long legs, you
make your steps too long. Duck-walk it. This
way. Waddle—waddle—waddle! See? Try it
again. Better. All right for that. One more
thing, though. Don’t neglect to hog every inch
the officials will let you get away with. Your
hand, the left if you use it to balance with, the
right if you use but one, will be in advance of
every portion of your body except your head.
Find out how far forward you can set your hand
without bringing your head beyond your scrimmage
line and always put it there. The difference
of even six inches counts. Now we’ll see
how much you remember. Let’s have two lines
here. I’ll snap the ball. This side’s attacking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Now remember that position first. All right.
Get down to it. Here we go!”</p>

<p>Afterwards, during the thirty minutes’ scrimmage
with the scrubs, Myers dogged the first team
every moment. “Keep your back straight, right
guard! Lock it! Watch your feet, right tackle!
That’s not the way I showed you, not by a long
sight! You played too high, left guard! You let
your man under you! Charge from below! Great
jumpin’ Judas! Use your hands, center! That
man ought never to have got through!” And so
it went, with Coach Cade making life merry for
the backs, Captain Gus doing a little criticizing
on his own hook and the quarter imploring the
gray empyrean for just one man who could keep
his signals straight! Jim played a long session
that Wednesday afternoon, and he finished with
the suspicion that football practice, as the season
neared its climax, was going to be something
quite different from anything he had imagined.
But he was going to like it. He knew that!</p>

<p>That evening coaches and players met again in
Mr. Cade’s quarters and a long session developed.
Jim was not among the eight or nine players invited,
and he spent most of the evening going over
the affairs of the Maine-and-Vermont Society,
which, with a present membership of nearly forty,
was in flourishing condition. Last of all, he
wrote politely imperative reminders to delinquent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
members on Clem’s small typewriter. Jim was
not an accomplished typist and he spent a good
deal more time than he would have consumed had
he written the notes by hand. But there is no
denying that the typed results possessed a certain
air of authority that Jim’s sprawling writing
would have failed to attain, and this in spite
of many erasures and several misspelled words.
Clem came back while Jim was still struggling
with the envelopes and offered advice of no value
and laughed immoderately at the way Jim’s
tongue stuck out when he was hunting for what
he called the “pedals.” Jim finally ended his
task and assembled the half-dozen missives atop
his chiffonier for delivery on the morrow, looking
not a little triumphant.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to put stamps on them?”
asked Clem from the depths of his arm-chair.</p>

<p>“Stamps cost money,” replied Jim, shaking
his head. “I’m my own postman.”</p>

<p>“That’s a swell society! Doesn’t allow the
secretary money for postage!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it does, but the secretary has good legs,”
countered Jim. “It’s no trouble to dump these
things in the letter boxes in the halls as I go by.
You see, Clem, I was brought up economical!”</p>

<p>“That so?” Clem yawned and began to unlace
a shoe. “Maybe they don’t have stamps in
Maine. I suppose when you write a letter at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
home, Jim, you put your snowshoes on and hike
across country with it, eh? Say, talking of societies,
how would you like to join Janus?”</p>

<p>“Me?” said Jim. “That the one you belong
to? What’s it cost?”</p>

<p>“Not much. Anyway, a fellow doesn’t generally
ask the cost of joining, old son; he looks
grateful and kisses his benefactor’s hand. Janus,
Jim, is—well, it’s Janus. ’Nough said. If you
belong to Janus you’re made for life.”</p>

<p>“Huh,” said Jim, “that’s what you hear about
all of ’em. Guess it’s too high for my pocket-book,
Clem. Much obliged, though.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a goof! This, old son, is one of
life’s fine moments. Why, dog my cats, you’re
only the third senior that’s ever been proposed.
Either you make it in your junior year or you
don’t make it at all.”</p>

<p>“Mean that I’ve been proposed? Who did it?
You?”</p>

<p>“Exactly. And I don’t think there’s any doubt
about you getting through. Hang it, show a
little enthusiasm, you cold-blooded fish! Don’t
you understand you’re being honored? Say
‘Hooray!’”</p>

<p>“Yeah, but, honest, Clem, I don’t believe I
could afford it. I’m sort of hard-up right now,
and I guess likely I’ll be that way for some time.”</p>

<p>“Well, but I thought— It’s none of my business,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Jim, but isn’t your father pretty comfortable?”</p>

<p>Jim shook his head. “No, he isn’t, Clem. Not
lately. I guess you don’t know what a hard time
country folks have nowadays, farmers especially.
They can’t get money for what they raise like
they could a few years ago. Up our way most
farmers raise potatoes for their main crop, but
they’re a good ways from the market and lots
of times it don’t pay ’em to ship ’em. Right on
our place I’ve seen more than two hundred
bushels raised on a little piece of ground and
piled in the cellar, and they’d be there, most of
’em, in the Spring. After you’d paid for bags
and carting and freight to Boston and commission
to the produce man you’d be out of pocket.
Same way with hogs and most everything else
now. There’s money in lumber, but it’s the fellows
in the cities gets it. When folks haven’t got
money to spend, they don’t spend it, and dad’s
business ain’t very good any more. The only
way I could come back here this year was by
earning some money last summer. That’s why
I went to that sporting camp. You see, I could
have gone to college this Fall if I’d been willing
to. I’d have had a couple of conditions, though,
and I thought it would be better to come here
another year. Besides, I—I got to liking Alton
pretty well, and when you wrote you were willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
to let me come in with you I just made up
my mind I’d put in another year here. But I
couldn’t very well ask dad to pay for all of it. I
made enough at the camp to pay my tuition, and
dad he allows me ten dollars a month for extras
and spending money. Now I’m in debt to you
five dollars, Clem, and I’ve got to go sort of careful
or I won’t have enough money to get home
Christmas time.”</p>

<p>“That’s kind of tough,” mused Clem. “Funny,
but I had an idea that your folks were pretty
well fixed. Anyhow, don’t you worry about getting
home, old son. There’s still money in the
strong-box!”</p>

<p>“I’d borrow if I found I had to, I guess,” said
Jim, “but I guess I won’t have to. Giving that
money to Webb—the fellow who was up here the
other day, you know,—sort of put me short, but
now he’s gone I guess I won’t—”</p>

<p>“Gosh! That reminds me, Jim! I’d nearly
forgotten it. Say, I don’t believe he has gone,
that guy. This afternoon I’ll swear I saw him
on West street. Or if it wasn’t him it was his
double. I didn’t have a very good look at him,
for he was going into that cigar store next to
the express office, but it sure looked like him,
clothes and all!”</p>

<p>Jim looked worried. “Maybe it was just some
fellow who looked like Webb,” he said. But his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
tone lacked conviction. “He promised me he’d
go to Norwalk the next morning, and I’d be right
sorry to find he hadn’t. Besides—” Jim didn’t
finish the sentence.</p>

<p>“Well, you should worry,” said Clem cheerfully.
“If he comes around here again just you
hand him over to me, old son. I’ve got a system
with pan-handlers and book agents and their ilk.
How’s that for a word? ‘Ilk’! I’ll say that’s
cute!”</p>

<p>But Clem couldn’t get Jim to smile. “It
wouldn’t do him any good to come to me again,”
he said soberly. “I haven’t got any more money.
I do wish, though, he’d gone like he said he
would. That is, if he ain’t.”</p>

<p>“Probably he has,” replied Clem encouragingly.
“I dare say I was just fooled by a resemblance,
Jim. After all, there’s quite a bunch
of fellows of his style around town since they
started the new factory up.” Secretly, though,
Clem was convinced that he had not been mistaken,
and two days later that conviction was
strengthened.</p>

<p>Presently, returning to the original subject of
discourse, he said: “About coming into Janus,
Jim. Suppose you just let it rest for a while.
There’s no great rush in the matter, anyway.
I’ll let your name go over the next meeting. That
will give you time to think it over. The expense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
isn’t much anyway. I’d tell you exactly, only it’s
against the rules to give out information of any
sort. You take a couple of weeks and think it
over. I want you to come in if you can possibly
do it, old son, so don’t say no now.”</p>

<p>So Jim didn’t say no. He merely shook his
head and, so to speak, laid the question on the
table. After that, while Clem, propped against
his pillow, read in bed, Jim took his football from
the closet shelf, snuggled it lovingly in his lap
and started all over again on the rules book.
When Clem’s book dropped from his hand and
he turned over and closed his eyes, his room-mate
was still fondling the ball and frowning
over the apparent intricacies of the following:
“Players of the side which did not put the ball
in play may use (1) their hands and arms to push
opponents out of the way in order to get at the
ball and (2) their bodies or their arms close to
the body to obstruct opponents who are going
down the field from getting at a player of their
own side who is endeavoring to get at the ball.”</p>

<p>Jim rubbed a hand across his eyes and read it
again. There were, he thought, too many “get
ats.” Maybe, though, he was too sleepy to—yes,
to “get at” the sense. He’d try it again to-morrow.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>AT THE POLICE STATION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>If Wednesday’s practice had been stiff Thursday’s
was adamantine. With the intention of providing
better defense for the drop-kickers the first
team was lined up near the goal and the substitutes
were set against them. With Steve Whittier
and Pep Kinsey alternating at kicking, all the rest
of the first team had to do was keep the substitutes
from breaking through or otherwise interfering
with the kick. Myers was behind the subs
and the manner in which he egged them on to
atrocities of attack proved him, in the minds of
the first team players, a man of singularly cruel
disposition. Friendship ceased and no quarter
was asked. Loring Cheswick at first, and then
Benning, sped the ball to the kicker and simultaneously
goaded by Myers’ commands to “Bust
it up! Get through! Use your hands!” and
“Fight ’em, Subs! Rip ’em up! Block that
kick!” the substitutes hurled themselves ferociously
forward and committed nearly everything
except murder.</p>

<p>Jim received hard knocks that afternoon. One
of the knocks set his nose to bleeding and another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
crippled his left leg for the rest of the proceedings.
But he managed to disguise the damage
to his leg, and, of course, a bleeding nose was
a mere incident, and so he managed to stay in
and to give a very good account of himself. And
it seemed once that the Demon Coach, as Myers
was dubbed that afternoon, had determined to
concentrate on Jim until he got results. He sent
a two-man tandem at the right tackle position
until he was finally satisfied that he was wasting
his time. Perhaps he concluded that he was wasting
players, too, for the members of the tandem,
especially the second man, got rather roughly
treated in the course of events! Jim found the
head of the tandem could be thrown off in time
to give full attention to the next comer, and,
while Jim got some hard knocks, he certainly wore
that second man out!</p>

<p>Sometimes the subs did get through and the ball
went anywhere save over the goal, and then you
should have heard Coach Cade become eloquent!
As Jake Borden, right end, remarked, Johnny’s
words were more refined-like but they cut deeper.
Later, when the scrimmage started, Jim discovered
to his dismay that he was playing with the
subs. He jumped to the conclusion that he had
been demoted and felt rather badly, which fact
told somewhat on his playing, and, when the second
team came over and took the place of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
substitutes Jim was one of those who were sent
to the showers. As a matter of fact he had been
placed with the substitute team to strengthen the
right of its line, and retired after the first half
of the scrimmage because in the opinion of Jake,
the trainer, he had seen service enough. But
Jim didn’t know that, and he returned to Haylow
rather down in the mouth.</p>

<p>Friday’s practice was less severe, with the emphasis
on signal drill and the handling of punts
and passes, and the first-string players went
through only a ten-minute scrimmage and were
then sent off. Jim’s misgivings were slightly assuaged
when he read the list of the players who
were to go to New Falmouth the next afternoon
and found his name on it. If he was very bad, he
argued, they wouldn’t pay his railway fare!
Then, feeling more chirpy, he went back to Number
15 Haylow and ran into trouble.</p>

<p>Clem, who had reached the room but a minute
before, was gazing perplexedly at the third
drawer in his chiffonier. He turned to Jim without
greeting to ask: “You haven’t had this
drawer open, have you, Jim?”</p>

<p>Jim blinked and shook his head. “No, Clem.
Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, just look at it, will you?” The drawer
held underwear, stockings, a blue flannel shirt,
a candy box with a piece of red Christmas ribbon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
trailing from it, a pair of discarded garters; possibly
other things as well, but Jim’s attention was
held by the number of undergarments in sight
and the general disorder of the drawer’s contents.
He looked inquiringly at Clem.</p>

<p>“Nice mess, eh?” asked Clem indignantly.
“Some one’s been poking around in here. Look
at that box. It was tied with that ribbon. Someone
opened it and didn’t do it up again.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I’m the only one who could have
done it if you didn’t,” said Jim slowly, “and I’ve
never been near anything of yours, Clem. So it
looks—”</p>

<p>“Of course you didn’t do it,” answered Clem.
“I needn’t have asked you, only I was so—so
blamed mad—”</p>

<p>“You’re sure you didn’t leave the box untied?”</p>

<p>“Me? Why, there’s nothing in the box but a
lot of old gimcracks”—he removed the lid impatiently
for Jim’s benefit—“and I haven’t had it
open since I put it in there. Besides, hang it all,
Jim, you know I wouldn’t leave this drawer looking
like that!”</p>

<p>Jim wasn’t convinced of it, but he nodded
agreement. “Who do you suppose—” he began.
Then he asked quickly; “Anything missing?”</p>

<p>“Missing? Why, no, I guess not. Gosh, there’s
nothing here any one would want!” He had begun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
putting the things in order again, folding
the garments and piling them neatly back in
place. He really seemed more disturbed by the
disorder of things than by the fact that some person
had intruded. “We’ll just have to lock the
door when we go out, Jim. I’ve been here three
years and this is the first time I’ve had anything
of mine troubled.”</p>

<p>“Suppose some one did it for a joke?” asked
Jim.</p>

<p>“Mighty poor joke,” Clem grumbled. “Any
one could come in here that wanted to when we’re
both out, but I don’t see why they’d want to muss
my drawer all up.”</p>

<p>“When did you look in here last, Clem?”</p>

<p>“This morning. I got a pair of socks out. It
was all right then.” Something rattled under his
hand as he spoke, and he picked up a steel key-ring
with five keys attached. “If folks are going
to get fresh this way,” he muttered, “I’d better
put these somewhere—” He stopped, stared
for an instant at the keys and then swung around
and strode to the closet. From the shelf he lowered
the black suit-case. In a moment he had unlocked
it and thrown the lid back. Jim, watching
over his shoulder, spoke relievedly.</p>

<p>“It’s there,” he said.</p>

<p>But Clem had the folded envelope in his hand,
and it was empty! He looked blankly over his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
shoulder. “Well, what do you know!” he ejaculated.
Jim shook his head.</p>

<p>“Sure it was there, Clem?”</p>

<p>“Great Scott, you saw me put it there, didn’t
you? Night before last, or night— Gosh, that
makes me sore!”</p>

<p>“How much was in the envelope?” asked Jim.</p>

<p>“Twenty-seven—no, twenty-two dollars. I lent
you five. That left a two-dollar bill and four
five-dollar gold-pieces. Oh, I don’t care such an
awful lot about the money, but <a href="#image03">it’s rotten to know
that there’s a thief in the dormitory</a>! Why, it
may be—”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 396px;">

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_144">It’s rotten to know that there’s a thief in the dormitory.</a></div>
</div>

<p>“It might have been some one from one of
the other halls,” said Jim. “Or maybe a sneak-thief
from outside.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it might be any one!” Clem slammed
the bag shut and tossed it back to the shelf. “He
was after those keys, whoever he was, and that’s
the reason he messed everything up so. But
how did he know where they were, eh? The other
drawers are just as I left them. How about
yours? Better have a look.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think they’ve been touched,” Jim reported.
“Guess whoever was in here came while
we were both out this afternoon. How long were
you gone?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t been here since about half-past two,
until just now. I was over at Upton for an hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
or more. Then Carl Stevens and I went downtown.
What time’s it now? Twenty past five?
Well, that’s nearly three hours. When were you
up last?”</p>

<p>“Just before practice. About five to three, I
guess.”</p>

<p>Clem, hands in pockets, stared at the floor and
then flung himself into a chair. “Well, I’m going
to report it. Something will have to be done
if a fellow can’t leave his room door unlocked.
I don’t care a hang about the money, Jim, but I’d
certainly like to catch the sneak that got it!”</p>

<p>Jim, still standing, nodded. “Come to think
of it, Clem, it wouldn’t be hard for a fellow to
walk in the Meadow street gate and go through
a dozen rooms if he found ’em empty. All he’d
have to do would be pretend that he was looking
for some fellow and didn’t know where he lived,
sort of.”</p>

<p>“The way you looked for Dolf Chapin last
year,” said Clem, managing a brief smile. “Still,
he’d have to get past Mr. Tarbot, and his door is
nearly always open and looks right into the corridor
down there.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I guess he isn’t always in,” said
Jim. “And even if he saw some one he mightn’t
know he wasn’t one of the fellows from another
hall. Gosh, I guess he can’t know more than
four hundred fellows by sight!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, but there’s never been any stealing like
that since I’ve been here,” objected Clem. “Folks
don’t come on the campus unless they’ve got business;
fellows from the presser’s or the laundry
or—and even they aren’t supposed to come upstairs.”</p>

<p>“They do it, though.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, but— Now think a minute, Jim.
It must have taken a good five minutes to find the
keys in that drawer—and you can see by the way
things were left that he must have had to hunt
for them—and get the suit-case down and unlock
it and lock it and put the keys back and everything.
An outsider wouldn’t dare take the risk,
Jim. How’d he know that one of us wouldn’t
walk in on him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it would be risky,” Jim owned somewhat
unwillingly.</p>

<p>“It sure would! No, sir, the guy that pulled
this trick knew that we were both out. I dare
say he watched us go. Then he had all the time
in the world.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but if he had so much time why did he
pull things around so in the drawer? Or why
didn’t he fix them back the way he found them?
He might have known that you’d notice and get
suspicious and miss the money.”</p>

<p>“Probably didn’t think about that. Oh, well,
I’ve got to go down and see Old Tarbox. Come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
along and give your evidence, old son. He will
ask a lot of questions, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you could make it clearer if you went
alone.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’d want to question you anyway,
sooner or later. Come on.”</p>

<p>So Jim went. Mr. Tarbot, whose suite of study,
bedroom and bath was the first on the right from
the dormitory entrance, bade them enter when
Clem had knocked on the half-open door and the
two filed in. The instructor was reading in a
deep chair set close to a window, but at sight of
Jim he suddenly sat up straight. “I’ve been
watching for you, Todd,” he announced briskly.
“Some one telephoned about ten minutes ago
from the Police Station. I didn’t understand
who he was. One of the officers, I fancy. He said
I was to ask you to come over there directly
you got in. He didn’t say what was wanted. I
hope your conscience is clear, my boy.” Mr.
Tarbot smiled to show that he was joking, but behind
the smile one might have detected anxiety.
Jim stared incredulously for an instant. Then
his face clouded suddenly.</p>

<p>“I’ll go right away, sir,” he replied.</p>

<p>Mr. Tarbot nodded and picked up his book
again. Clem, his mission forgotten for the
moment, followed Jim to the corridor. “What
the dickens do you suppose they want?” he asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
with lively curiosity. Jim shook his head. “Well,
I’ll go along and see you through,” chuckled
Clem. “Nothing like having a friend at court,
old son!”</p>

<p>Jim stopped at the bottom of the steps and
shook his head again. “You needn’t come, Clem,”
he said. “You’d better see Tarbot about—”</p>

<p>“Oh, that can wait. This is a lot more exciting.
Go? You bet I’ll go. Why, I may have to
bail you out!”</p>

<p>After an instant of indecision Jim went on and
Clem fell in beside him, chattering animatedly
to apparently deaf ears. Jim looked troubled,
and by the time they were half-way toward the
main gate Clem noted the fact and, after a second
puzzled glance at his companion, said: “Look
here, old son, if you’d really rather I didn’t go
along I won’t.”</p>

<p>Jim shook his head once more. “No, you
might as well come, I guess. If it’s what I think
it is—”</p>

<p>“What do you think it is?” asked Clem when
the other paused.</p>

<p>“Webb,” said Jim after a moment. “The
fellow I lent the money to. Maybe he didn’t go
away, like he said he would, and maybe he’s got
in trouble with the police.”</p>

<p>Clem whistled expressively. “Bet you that’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
just it!” he murmured. “I didn’t want to say
so, Jim, but I was absolutely certain that was he
I saw that day on West street.”</p>

<p>Jim nodded and they crossed Academy street
in silence and went into State. “Know where it
is?” asked Jim presently. “The police place, I
mean.”</p>

<p>“Yes, turn to the left on West. It’s about
four blocks over and one through. Opposite the
Odd Fellow’s building. Say, if they want money
to let him out, Jim, we’re in a mess, eh?”</p>

<p>Once more Jim nodded affirmatively. After
that conversation was virtually prohibited by the
fact that the home-seeking throngs on the busy
streets made it nearly impossible for the two
boys to stay together. After a five-minute hurried
walk they reached the Police Station, an old
red-brick building with an entrance of granite
steps and rusty iron-railings much too large for
the small, square edifice. Past the doorway, Jim
paused in doubt, but Clem, with a familiarity that
might have seemed suspicious to one of uncharitable
mind, straightway guided him to the right
and into a scantily furnished apartment occupied
principally by a broad oak railing, a large, flat-topped
desk and a large red-faced man in a blue
uniform. There were some minor furnishings
too, such as a few chairs, a telephone, three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
framed pictures and a wobbly costumer which
sagged sidewise under the weight of a policeman’s
overcoat.</p>

<p>The big man behind the desk was proclaimed
a sergeant by the insignia on his sleeve and the
letters on the hat that perched rakishly on the
back of his bristly head. There was a cigar in
one corner of his mouth, a much-chewed, down-at-the-side
cigar that gave off rank fumes of
gray smoke and caused the sergeant to close one
eye as he viewed the arrivals.</p>

<p>“My name,” announced Jim in a voice so
fraught with guilt that the sergeant would have
been entirely justified in locking him up instantly,
“is Todd. They said over at school that
some one wanted to see me here—about something.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! Sure, young feller. Say, just step
in the next room, will you? That’s the door. The
Captain’s in there and he’ll ’tend to you. Sure,
you can go in, too, if you want.” The latter part
of the invitation was to Clem, who had hesitated
to follow his companion. So Clem trod closely
on the heels of Jim, and they passed through a
heavy door and found themselves in a second
room that was much like the first. Here, though,
there was a brilliantly red carpet on the floor,
the desk was a roll-top, there was an inhospitable
looking leather couch along one wall and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
single occupant, instead of being large and red
of countenance, was tall and lean, with a military
carriage and a healthily tanned face.</p>

<p>“Todd, eh?” he asked tersely. “Sit down,
please. This gentleman a friend of yours? I
see. Very well. I have a question or two to ask,
Mr. Todd. Know a man who calls himself James
Webster?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.” Relief struggled with doubt in
Jim’s face.</p>

<p>“Didn’t think you did, because I guess that
isn’t the fellow’s right name. Know any one with
a name like that?”</p>

<p>“I know a man whose name is Webb,” faltered
Jim. “His first name, I mean.”</p>

<p>“Webb, eh? What’s his last name?”</p>

<p>Jim’s hesitation was pronounced, but he finally
answered, “Todd, sir.”</p>

<p>Clem shot a quick, startled look at Jim. Jim
didn’t meet it. He was staring anxiously at the
police captain.</p>

<p>“Webb Todd? I see. Relative of yours?”</p>

<p>“Cousin; sort of. His mother and my mother
were half-sisters.”</p>

<p>“Not exactly a cousin, then, my boy. Known
him long?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, ever since I can remember. Up in
Maine. He lived right near us for a good while.”</p>

<p>“Seen him lately?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir, twice. Once I met him on the street
and the next time he came to our room in Haylow
Hall. Is—has he been arrested?”</p>

<p>The Captain nodded. “Yes, we took him in
charge about four o’clock. He’s been loafing
around town for several days. He will be up in
court in the morning charged with vagrancy. I
dare say he’ll get off with a suspended sentence if
he agrees to quit town.”</p>

<p>Jim breathed loudly with relief.</p>

<p>“Only thing puzzles us,” continued the Captain,
“is where he got what we took off him.”
He opened a drawer at his side and took out a
small parcel. “Ever lend him money, Mr.
Todd?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“How much money?”</p>

<p>Jim hesitated again. “Eight dollars and a
half,” he answered.</p>

<p>“That all?” Jim nodded. “Haven’t forgotten
any?” Jim shook his head. “Funny,” said
the Captain. He opened the parcel, displaying
a soiled envelope with a letter showing beyond
its torn edge, a cheap-pocket knife and an assortment
of coins. Three of the coins glittered
brightly in the light from the near-by window.
“This fellow had sixteen dollars and forty-one
cents when we searched him. Fifteen dollars was
in five-dollar gold coins. We asked him where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
got them. He said”—the Captain eyed Jim intently—“you
gave them to him.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence. Jim was still
staring wide-eyed at the officer. Clem was staring
fascinatedly at the three gold coins. Then
the Captain’s voice came again. “Of course, if
you didn’t give them to him he probably stole
them and it’ll be up to us to find out where. It
probably won’t be hard, for gold-pieces are scarce
and folks who have them miss them if they disappear.
I didn’t believe the fellow’s statement,
because it didn’t seem likely to me that any of
you fellows at the school would have so much
money on hand. Judging from the condition he
was in when we took charge of him, he must have
had considerably more to start with. Anyhow,
that’s his story. Says he was looking for work
and was strapped and asked you for a loan and
you came across with twenty dollars in five dollar
coins. He was lying, eh?”</p>

<p>Silence again. Clem’s gaze was on Jim. Jim’s
was on the bright red carpet. Jim moistened his
lips with his tongue and looked again at the questioner.
He shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, sir, he wasn’t lying,” he said evenly. “I
had—forgotten.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’d forgotten.” The Captain’s gaze
narrowed. “It’s a bad idea to forget things,
Todd, when it’s the police who want to know,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
he went on dryly. “You did give him the money,
did you? How much?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-two dollars—the last time, sir.”</p>

<p>“To-day?” Jim nodded. “Part gold, was it?”</p>

<p>“Four five-dollar gold-pieces and a two dollar
bill,” replied Jim.</p>

<p>“Quite a lot of money for you to have, wasn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>The Captain stared at Jim a moment longer.
Then his gaze shifted to the collection of coins at
his elbow. He wrapped the paper about them
again and tossed the packet back in the drawer.
“Well, all right,” he said finally. “He says you
did and you say you did, and so I guess that
settles it. That’s all, Mr. Todd. Much obliged
to you.”</p>

<p>“He won’t be sent to jail, will he?” asked Jim.</p>

<p>“Don’t believe so. He ought to be, for he looks
to me like a bad egg. If you like to come over
to-morrow about nine-thirty and speak to the
Judge, I’ll fix it for you. You might say a good
word for the man if you’ve known him so long.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to,” answered Jim gratefully. Then,
hesitantly, “Could I see him, please, sir?”</p>

<p>“I guess so.” He pressed a button on the edge
of the desk and, when an elderly man in a police
uniform appeared, waved toward Jim. “This
gentleman wants to see the nut that was brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
in this afternoon; Webster’s the name he’s entered
under. Just show him down, Grogan.”</p>

<p>Jim followed the turnkey without a glance toward
Clem.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Jim emerged from the station.
Clem had not waited. Jim made his way
back to school alone, hurrying at times, since the
six o’clock whistle had long since blown, and at
other times slowing to a pace that indicated that
his thoughts were concerned with a subject more
weighty than supper.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>MR. WEBB TODD</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Although Jim went directly back to Number 15
after his delayed supper he did not find Clem
there. Perhaps, he thought, Clem had been there
and, not finding him, had gone to look for him. In
a way Jim was not sorry, for the explanation that
was Clem’s due wasn’t going to be easy to make.
He prepared to write a letter to his father, but,
with pen hovering above paper, his thoughts went
back to his talk with Webb and the letter was forgotten.</p>

<p>Webb had been so glad to see him that Jim’s
anger had softened instantly, even though the
former had shown no signs of contrition. He had
been perfectly frank. Leaning against the sill
of a barred window at one end of the corridor
that extended along the front of the cells, Webb
had explained everything in matter-of-fact
fashion. After he had got that five dollars from
Jim he had changed his mind about going to Norwalk
just then. He didn’t see any sense in working
so long as he had money. But yesterday the
money had given out and in the afternoon he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
gone to Haylow to ask for another loan. If he
had got it he would have jumped the train at four
and gone to Norwalk. Anyway, he had really
meant to then. But no one had answered his
knock, and he had gone in. He had looked around
a bit and then sat down, intending to wait for
Jim’s return. It wasn’t until then that the idea
of taking Clem’s money had occurred to him.</p>

<p>When he had called there before and Jim had
gone back into the room to ask Clem for the loan
Webb had watched and listened through a crack
in the door, for Jim had not quite closed it. He
had seen Clem take the bunch of keys from the
drawer and go to the closet. After that the action
had been outside his range of vision, but his ears
had supplied him with what his eyes had missed.
So yesterday it had been easy enough. He had
had trouble finding the keys, for they had become
tucked into a fold of a garment, but after he had
them what followed was fair sailing. A few
minutes later, opening the door cautiously on an
empty corridor, he had walked away again and
down the stairs. Near the front door he had
seen, both on entering and leaving, a “funny-looking
sketch with a trick mustache readin’ a book,
but he didn’t pay no attention to me, kid.” He
went out the gate to Meadow street and returned
to the village. There he visited a lunch-room and
had a good feed, and it was while he was standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
harmlessly in front of it that “a cop come along
and pinched me.”</p>

<p>Webb had seemed neither proud nor ashamed
nor greatly concerned with his present plight.
He had heard that the Judge here was a “good
guy,” and they didn’t have anything on him, anyway,
because they couldn’t send a guy up for vagrancy
when he had more than fifteen dollars in
his pocket and was tryin’ hard to find a job.
Webb had winked there.</p>

<p>“But suppose they found out you’d stolen that
money, Webb?”</p>

<p>“How could they? I told ’em you gave it to
me. All you got to do is tell ’em the same story,
kid.”</p>

<p>“That would make me a thief, Webb.”</p>

<p>“How would it? I’ll be out o’ here to-morrow,
and all you got to do is tell that guy the facts.
Say, ain’t they asked you about it yet?” Jim nodded.
“Well, what did you tell ’em?”</p>

<p>“That I gave it to you—lent it to you—this
afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Sure! Well, that’s all right, ain’t it? They
can’t do nothin’ to me if you stick to that,
kid!”</p>

<p>“If I do stick to it, Webb, you’ve got to make
me a promise and keep it.”</p>

<p>“Sure I will! You know me, kid. You and me
was always the best ’o pals, and I ain’t the kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
of a guy to go back on my friends. What’s it you
want me to do?”</p>

<p>“I want you to leave here on the first train
after they let you go, Webb, and find a job and
stick to it. You know mighty well this way of living
ain’t going to get you anywhere, Webb. Gosh,
when I was a kid I thought you were just about
the finest fellow in the world! You were always
mighty good to me, Webb, and I just can’t forget
it. I want you should quit this business and
be like you used to be. You can if you’ll try,
Webb, I know you can!”</p>

<p>“Sure!” Webb Todd’s voice had been a little
husky. “You’re dead right, too, kid. This is
a rotten life, and I know it. But—” He had
sort of run down there. After a moment he said
almost wistfully: “Say, kid, I wasn’t a bad sort
back in the old days, was I? You and me had
some swell times, didn’t we? Remember the time
the old red sow got out and we was chasin’ it and
it ran in the kitchen and your ma was making
bread and the old sow came out with the pan o’
dough on her head?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I remember the time I fell between
the logs in Beecher’s Cove and you dived in and
got me out, Webb.”</p>

<p>“Sure.” Webb had nodded reminiscently.
“You come near kicking in that time, kid.”
After a moment’s silence Jim had asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, will you do it, Webb?”</p>

<p>“I’ll try, kid.”</p>

<p>“You mean it? You promise me you’ll really
try, Webb? Try as hard as you know how?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I’ll try hard. I don’t know as I’ll make
it, kid. A guy gets sort o’ used to doin’ without
a job after a while. It ain’t so hard, kid. If
you’ve got a good spiel you won’t never starve.
There’s a lot of mushy folks in the world. You’d
be surprised how easy they fall for a hard-luck
steer, kid.”</p>

<p>“Just as I did,” Jim had said.</p>

<p>“Yeah. But, say, kid, honest I wasn’t meanin’
to bleed you. I really meant to go to Norwalk
the day after I first saw you, just like I told you.
But somethin’ sort o’ prevented.”</p>

<p>“There’s another thing, Webb. I’m going to
see the Judge in the morning before he goes into
court. The Police Captain said he’d fix it so I
could. And I’m going to tell him you ain’t really
a—a loafer, and about how good you used to be
to me, Webb, and I guess he won’t be hard on
you. But if I do that you must give me back that
money, what’s left of it.”</p>

<p>“All of it? Well, but listen, kid, how am I
goin’ to get to Norwalk?”</p>

<p>“I’ll bring you enough for that. How much
does it cost on the train?”</p>

<p>“Four dollars.” Jim blinked at that, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Webb had said: “That’s a lie, kid. Two-eighty’s
the price.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get it. That other money, what you stole
from Clem Harland, must go back to him. Remember,
Webb, I’ll have to pay back what you
used of it, and the five dollars I borrowed for
you besides, and it ain’t going to be easy.
Father’s pretty hard up this year, and I don’t get
but ten dollars a month.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I know about your father. I wrote and
tried to make a touch awhile back, but nothin’
stirrin’. Well, what you say goes, kid. You’re
sure white, and I won’t forget it.”</p>

<p>When he had reached the door Webb had called:
“Say, kid, if you’ve got a quarter you ain’t
needin’ you might hand it to the old guy there an’
tell him to fetch me in some supper. I’ll bet the
<em>cuisine</em> at this hotel’s rotten.”</p>

<p>Jim had thrust a hand into an empty pocket and
replied regretfully: “I haven’t got it, Webb.”</p>

<p>“All right, kid. Don’t you worry. I ate good
a while back. See you to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Now, staring at the unsullied sheet of note
paper before him and tapping his teeth with the
end of his fountain pen, Jim was wondering
where and how he was to get two dollars and
eighty cents to give to Webb in the morning. He
was determined that all that was left of Clem’s
twenty-two dollars should go back to him untouched.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Webb ought to have more than the
mere price of his fare, too. He seemed certain
that he had only to reach Norwalk to find work,
but he would have to have money for food to eat
to-morrow and the part of the next at least. Four
dollars wouldn’t be a cent too much. Jim went
to his closet and looked over his none too ample
wardrobe. Jim knew nothing of institutions that
loaned money on personal property and allowed
you the privilege of redeeming it; he was trying
to decide whether his heavy winter overcoat
which, if truth were told, was far heavier than it
was warm, or the light-weight suit he had worn
back to school in the fall could be best given up.
Either one ought to sell for a good deal more than
four dollars; but how much more he didn’t know.
His movements dislodged the football from the
shelf above and it dropped with a startling thud
on his head. He picked it up and was looking it
over appraisingly when the door opened and Clem
entered.</p>

<p>Clem said “Hello,” glancing briefly from Jim’s
face to the ball in his hands, and turned to his
own closet to hang up his cap. If there was anything
unaccustomed in his tone Jim didn’t notice
it. He was thinking of what he had to say and
wondering how Clem was going to take it. He
walked back to the table, stared down at the waiting
letter paper and, when Clem turned away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
from the closet, said: “I’m terribly sorry about
what happened to-day, Clem.”</p>

<p>After a slight hesitation Clem replied: “Yes.
Well, so am I, Jim.” It sounded as though he
had tried to speak lightly, but he had only succeeded
in sounding oddly stiff. Jim looked across
inquiringly, but Clem had seated himself on his
side of the table and was pulling over his books.</p>

<p>“I’m going to get what’s left of that money
in the morning,” Jim continued, “and give it
back to you. There’s only a little over sixteen
dollars of it, though, and so I’m owing you eleven
now. I’m going to write to dad and ask him to
send me ten and take it out of my December and
January allowances. Then—then I thought of
another way, but I don’t know—I ain’t sure about
that yet.”</p>

<p>“Don’t bother about it,” said Clem. “I don’t
care a hang if you never pay it back.” He opened
a book, propped his elbows and indicated that the
subject was closed. Something in his voice and
attitude puzzled Jim, and he jumped to a conclusion.</p>

<p>“I guess I know how you feel,” he said. “It—it
isn’t very pleasant to find that the fellow
you’re rooming with has a cousin—well, a sort
of a cousin—who’s a—a thief. I sort of wish you
hadn’t gone over there with me, Clem.”</p>

<p>Clem lifted his head and stared a moment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Then he laughed shortly. “Well, I can certainly
believe that!” he said.</p>

<p>“What I mean is if you hadn’t known about
Webb, about his being related to me, it wouldn’t
have troubled you. But I’d sort of like you to
believe that he ain’t—isn’t really bad, Clem. If
you had known him five or six years ago—”</p>

<p>“Look here, Jim, let me understand you. This
cousin of yours, or whatever he is, is a ne’er-do-well,
all right; I guess you could call him a bum
without being sued for libel, but just what do
you mean by calling him a thief?”</p>

<p>“Why, I—well, I don’t want to call him that,
Clem, because I—I’m awfully fond of him, but I
guess I’ve got to, haven’t I, after what happened?”</p>

<p>“What did happen?” asked Clem brusquely.</p>

<p>Jim stared in puzzlement. “Why, he stole
your money, Clem!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see. Your cousin stole it.”</p>

<p>“Well—well, didn’t he?” asked Jim. “Didn’t
you see it? Didn’t you hear what that man said,
the Police Captain? I thought—”</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw and heard both, Jim, and— Look
here, suppose we leave the word ‘stole’ out of it.
Let’s say ‘borrowed.’ It sounds better. Anyway,
what’s the good of talking about it any
more? You’re sorry and I’m sorry. Let it go
that way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“We-ell, all right,” answered Jim dubiously.
“Only I wanted you to know that you were going
to get your money back, Clem.”</p>

<p>“I’ve told you I didn’t care about that. Besides,
hang it all, Jim, if this fellow Webb stole
it why don’t you let him pay it back? If he stole
it where does your liability come in?”</p>

<p>“Why, he couldn’t pay it back, Clem. Or he
wouldn’t, I guess. He’s promised to go straight,
but I don’t know if he will. I’m responsible, of
course. If it wasn’t for me he wouldn’t have
come here and taken it.”</p>

<p>“When was it he took it?” asked Clem coldly.</p>

<p>“About three, he said. The other night he saw
you get your keys out and open the suit-case, and
he heard us talking, and to-day—”</p>

<p>“Saw us through the door, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, he says the door wasn’t quite closed.
But he didn’t think of stealing the money until
to-day. He came up here to ask me for another
loan, and we were both out, and he remembered
about the money in the suit-case and—and took
it.”</p>

<p>“And no one saw him?” asked Clem incredulously.</p>

<p>“He says Mr. Tarbot saw him go by his study
but didn’t pay any attention.”</p>

<p>“That’s hard to believe. And look here, Jim,
I don’t remember that door being ajar. My recollection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
is that you closed it tight when you came
in from the hall.”</p>

<p>“I guess I meant to, but maybe I didn’t, because
Webb saw you go to your drawer and get
the keys.”</p>

<p>Clem jumped up impatiently, went to the door
and set it open an inch or two. “Like that?” he
asked, with a trace of sarcasm. “Tell me how he
could have seen me go to the closet and open the
bag on the floor there.”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t.” Jim was finding his chum’s
manner more puzzling every minute. “He didn’t
say he did. He only said he saw you open the
drawer and get the bunch of keys. The rest
he just heard.”</p>

<p>Clem shrugged as he closed the door again and
went back to his chair. Jim was watching him
anxiously, disturbed by something he couldn’t define.
“Over there at the police station,” said
Clem, after a moment’s silence, “the Captain told
us that your—friend said he got the money from
you.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Jim, frowning.</p>

<p>“And you said so, too, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Of course! What else could I say? I <em>had</em> to
lie, Clem. If I hadn’t they’d have accused him
of theft. I thought you understood why I was doing
it!”</p>

<p>“Oh! Yes, I see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly Jim realized. Indignation sent the
blood flooding up into his cheeks and for an instant
his hands clutched the back of the chair
on which they rested until the knuckles showed
white. He stifled the exclamation of angry dismay
that rushed to his lips, and in the moment
he realized that, on evidence alone, Clem was
fairly entitled to his belief. Yes, circumstances
undoubtedly pointed to him rather than to Webb
as the culprit! But the thought that Clem could
believe him a thief, on any sort of evidence save
that of his own eyesight, hurt him horribly. He
felt almost sick for a minute.</p>

<p>Clem’s eyes were on the book opened before
him, but I doubt that he saw the words there.
He was secretly at odds with himself. He had
returned to the room determined to make no reference
to the affair of the stolen money. It had
not occurred to him that Jim had sought to protect
Webb. It did not occur to him now, seriously.
Webb had demanded more money, Jim had known
about the twenty-two dollars and had yielded to
a sudden temptation. That was how Clem figured
it. The mere act of thievery didn’t seem
so bad to him, nor did the loss of the money—if
it proved a loss—trouble him at all. But he felt
terribly injured, spiritually bruised, by the revelation
that Jim could do so small and mean an act.
He had, almost without realizing it, grown very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
fond of Jim, and now the discovery that the latter
was not worthy of the affection wounded him
sorely. But he had meant to keep all this to himself;
Jim, he had thought, would be glad to say
no more of the affair; and he would have done so
if Jim had not made matters worse by attempting
to shift the blame to Webb. That had turned
Clem’s sorrow to disgust and, finally, to something
close to anger. To him, accusing Webb was
far worse than taking the money. The latter was
capable of palliation if one granted sudden temptation,
but to seek to clear himself at the expense
of another, one who could not testify on his own
behalf, was indefensible; it was the worst of all
offenses to Clem’s eyes, it was poor sportsmanship!</p>

<p>Jim’s voice broke the silence finally. It was
harsh and strained, for he was trying desperately
to hide his hurt, and it was so low that it scarcely
carried across the table.</p>

<p>“Clem,” he said, “are you thinking that I
stole that money?”</p>

<p>Clem looked up, his face oddly expressionless.
“I thought we had agreed to leave that word out
of it.”</p>

<p>“What does it matter what you call it?” asked
Jim, his voice trembling a trifle in spite of his
efforts to keep it steady. “You are thinking it!
You don’t dare look me in the face and deny it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Clem frowned. “Let’s not be tiresome, Jim.
It’s done. Let’s not say anything more about it.”</p>

<p>There was another silence. Then: “All right,”
said Jim. “I will never speak of it again—until
you do.” The strained expression went out of
his face, but it remained white and grim as he
seated himself in his chair and took up his pen
once more. Now there was no hesitation. The
sprawling letters followed each other rapidly
across the white sheet. “Friday,” he wrote;
“Dear Father: I am sorry to have to ask you for
money again but I must have twelve dollars within
a few days. This is right important. I want
you should take it out of my allowances for December,
January and February, so I’m not asking
anything extra. Please try hard to send me
this twelve dollars just as soon as you get this
letter. I’m not in trouble, so you don’t need to
be worried any, and when I see you I’ll tell you
what I have to have it for. I am well and getting
along nicely—”</p>

<p>Jim paused there and stared sadly at the base
of the lamp for a long moment before he went on.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>IN THE JUDGE’S CHAMBER</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Jim was the first one at the training table the
next morning and the first one away, and it
wasn’t much after half-past eight when he
emerged from Haylow and made his way across
the campus. Under one arm he carried his football.
At West street he turned to the left and,
about a third of the way along the block, turned in
under a swinging sign on which a football was
portrayed. It was a prosperous looking store
whose well-filled shelves and cases and counters
offered everything in the athletic and sporting
goods lines. At this time of morning there were
no customers, and the only occupant was a youth
of nineteen or twenty, a graduate of the Academy
and a resident of the town. To him Jim explained
his errand.</p>

<p>“I bought this football here awhile back,” he
stated, “and it’s never been used any to speak of.
Hasn’t even been out of my room until to-day.
You can see it’s almost like new.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see, but what’s the matter with it?”
The clerk was examining the stitching frowningly.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said Jim, “but I ain’t got any more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
use for it and I thought maybe you could sell it
again.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know. It’s just about as good
as a new one, Mr. Todd; I’ve got you right,
haven’t I? You are Todd of the Eleven, aren’t
you? I thought so. Well, as I was saying, I’d
like to oblige you, but we don’t very often have
calls for second-hand footballs. I don’t suppose
we ever had, still I’ll be glad to do what I can for
you. I’ll take it on sale, Mr. Todd. It’s kind of
late now, though, and the demand for footballs is
about over.”</p>

<p>“I wanted you to buy it from me,” said Jim.
“I need the money right away.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Well, I don’t see how we could do that.
If Mr. Emerson was here he might be willing to
do it, but he isn’t. I don’t see much of him at this
time of the year. Guess he’s pretty busy playing
football. He telephones a couple of times a week,
but he may not call up to-day.”</p>

<p>Jim’s disappointment showed plainly. “Well,
I’ve got to have the money this morning,” he
muttered. “I—I’d sell it back to you right
cheap.”</p>

<p>“How cheap?” asked the clerk. “You paid
seven for this, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Six-thirty. I got the academy discount.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. Well, how much do you want
for it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“Four,” answered Jim.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t say it isn’t worth it,” said the
other dubiously, “but I guess three and a half
would be the best I could get for it, if it sold at
all.”</p>

<p>“Three and a half?” Jim considered. “All
right, I’ll take three and a half.”</p>

<p>“I may get stuck on it,” said the clerk hesitantly,
“but I’ll take a chance. Mind, I’m doing
this, not the store, Mr. Todd. I wouldn’t have
any right to risk the store’s money like this.”</p>

<p>Jim nodded. The point wasn’t important to
him, and he was trying to think of some way in
which to get the other fifty cents of the four dollars.
The clerk took three dollars and a half from
his pocket, handed the sum across the counter and
the transaction was completed. Jim hurried out.</p>

<p>Had he passed that way half an hour later and
looked in the left-hand window he would have
seen his ball prominently displayed above a card
on which was printed: “Shopworn—A Bargain
at $4.50.”</p>

<p>Further along on the opposite side of the street
was a tiny jewelry store. On the single narrow
window was printed “The Diamond Palace—I.
Kohn &amp; Son.” Crossing the street, Jim removed
his cuff-links. Whether they were solid gold or
merely plated had never interested him before,
but he hoped now that they were solid. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
were, and after Mr. Kohn, Junior, a personable
youth with extremely red cheeks, a diminutive
black mustache and brilliantly shining hair
smoothed back from his forehead, had carefully
satisfied himself on that point he asked severely:
“You want to sell them?”</p>

<p>Jim said that he did. Young Mr. Kohn
shrugged, laid them back on a rusty square of
purple velvet and pushed the square toward the
customer. “We don’t buy second-hand jewelry,”
he said. Jim picked up the links. “If you want
to sell those for old gold, we’ll pay you what
they’re worth.”</p>

<p>Jim hesitated. “How much?” he asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Kohn, Junior, weighed the links on a small
scales, out of sight of Jim, by the way, and replied;
“A dollar and a half. They don’t weigh
quite so much, but I’ll call it a dollar and a half
even.”</p>

<p>“They’re worth more than that,” answered
Jim, remembering that there were at least six
more jewelry stores in town.</p>

<p>“Not for old gold they ain’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I don’t want to sell them,” said
Jim.</p>

<p>“How much you think they’re worth?” asked
the other, still keeping the cuff-links.</p>

<p>“Two dollars.”</p>

<p>“You’re making fun of me,” answered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
other, smiling patiently. “I ain’t saying they
ain’t worth two dollars to you for cuff-links, because
maybe they’d be worth three, but
for old gold—”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Jim, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>“Say, ain’t you one of the fellows that plays
with the football team over to the Academy?”
asked young Mr. Kohn.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Sure! I recognized you when I see you coming
in the door. You was playing in that game last
week, wasn’t you? Sure! Well, now, listen, to
you I’ll say a dollar and seventy-five cents. If
papa was here he’d skin me, but I’m a great feller
for football, and—”</p>

<p>Jim was pointing through the top of the case
to a pair of cheap imitation gold cuff-links fixed
in a small card. “I’ll let you have them for a
dollar, seventy-five and those links there.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t, positively!” Mr. Kohn, Junior, extracted
the links in question from the tray and
read the cryptic figures on a corner of the soiled
card. “Say, you know what these sell for. Sixty-five
cents! Look for yourself!”</p>

<p>“‘g n l’” read Jim. “That don’t spell sixty-five
to me; it spells twenty-five.”</p>

<p>Perhaps Mr. Kohn, Junior, was not without a
sense of humor, for he chuckled quite humanly,
hesitated a moment and finally turned to a huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
safe at the back of the narrow shop. “Say, you
got a cheek, ain’t you?” he asked almost approvingly.
“I got to give you that. I guess you football
fellers is great bluffers maybe.” He counted
out a dollar and seventy-five cents. “There you
are, Mister. Call again. Good morning.” Jim
took the money and the awful cuff-links and departed.
After he had gone young Mr. Kohn
rubbed his purchase diligently with a soiled
chamois, fixed them to a card, wrote “l d b” in a
corner and placed them on a glass shelf. In the
obscure code of the Diamond Palace “l d b” signified
that the article was to be disposed of for five
dollars. As, however, the proprietors permitted
themselves the privilege of reducing their goods
twenty per centum below the marked prices to
secure a sale it was possible that Jim’s cuff-links
might some day go for as little as four dollars.</p>

<p>On his way to the Police Station Jim put his
new purchases in place and felt vastly more comfortable.
The Captain was not in, but the stout
Sergeant served as well and conducted Jim up
a broad flight of much-worn steps to the second
floor of the building. Facing the top of the staircase,
a wide portal, its double doors swung open,
showed the court room in possession of a few
loungers and a clerk busily at work under the
judge’s desk. Jim, however, was conducted past
the doorway and to a smaller door at the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the hall. The Sergeant knocked, received no
answer and looked in.</p>

<p>“He ain’t come yet. You set down, kid, and
make yourself comfortable. He’ll be along in a
minute or two.”</p>

<p>The Sergeant left him and Jim took one of the
several severe-looking chairs and waited. He
didn’t have to wait long, for presently brisk steps
sounded on stairs and corridor and a middle-aged
man in a closely-fitting suit of small gray
checks and a bright red necktie swung through
the doorway. Jim arose. The Judge grunted,
dropped a bag on the desk, placed a morning
paper atop, hung his derby hat in a wardrobe,
sank into a swivel chair and lighted a cigar. All
these things were done very briskly, so that Jim
was on his feet less than a minute before the
Judge waved him back to it.</p>

<p>“Want to see me?” asked the Judge in an accusing
voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, if you please.” Jim wondered if he
should have said “Your Honor.” But if he had
failed in respect the Judge let it pass. He shifted
his cigar so that the smoke allowed him a view of
the visitor and, after a longing glance at the
newspaper, crossed one plump knee over the
other.</p>

<p>“What about?”</p>

<p>“About one of the—the prisoners, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“Coming before me this morning?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, so the Police Captain said, and he
said I could see you before court began and tell
you about him. You see, Judge, Webb is all right,
only—”</p>

<p>“What’s his name?”</p>

<p>“Webb Todd, but he called himself Webster
when they arrested him.”</p>

<p>“Gave an assumed name, eh? What’s he
charged with?”</p>

<p>“Vagrancy, sir.”</p>

<p>“That all?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, there have been too many vagrants
around here lately, and I guess it’s about time
some of them were made examples of. What do
you know about this Webster?”</p>

<p>So Jim, beginning rather timorously but soon
forgetting his awe of the listener, said his say.
He made Webb out rather a fine character, and
once or twice the Judge’s cigar trembled in his
mouth and the Judge’s keen gray eyes, which
weren’t really half so steel-like as he tried to
make them, softened. Jim told how Webb had
taught him to swim and pull an oar and use a
paddle and had, in short, looked after him like an
elder brother for so many years. And he told
how Webb had dived into icy water that time when
Jim had gone beneath the logs and had saved his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
life. Now and then the Judge asked a question,
and one of them was “What’s your name?” and
another was “You’re the boy they call ‘Slim’
Todd, aren’t you?” And finally, to Jim’s utter
surprise, he and the Judge were talking football!</p>

<p>The Judge knew football, too. There wasn’t
any doubt as to that. He had played it in school
and college, and, although that had been a good
twenty years before, he still followed the game
and was an ardent “fan”; and traveled many
miles each November to see his college meet its
ancient rival. He hadn’t missed an Alton game
so far this season, he told Jim, but he didn’t believe
he’d be able to make the trip to New Falmouth
this afternoon. Then he asked if Jim was
going to play, and Jim said he expected to, and
the Judge sighed and pushed his newspaper
aside and made finger spots on the polished mahogany
surface of the desk and moved his hands
hither and yon and explained to Jim in detail the
way in which he had got away around the enemy’s
right on a certain blustery afternoon many years
ago and sped twenty-six yards for the touchdown
that had won the game. And Jim, watching
and listening, saw the picture clearly and said
“<em>Gee!</em>” once or twice with bated breath and
sighed with vast relief when the Judge—only, of
course, he wasn’t the Judge then—tore loose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
from the last tackler and fell across the blurred
white line!</p>

<p>Then there was a knock on the door that led
to the court room and the Judge straightened himself
back in his chair and looked very judge-like
on the instant. When the Clerk entered the Judge
shook hands with Jim and walked to the corridor
door with him. “I’m glad to have met you, Mr.
Todd,” he said in his best judicial tones. “Good
morning.” But the Judge’s hand pressed Jim’s
very hard, and so Jim found courage to ask before
the door closed behind them: “And about—about
Webb, sir? You’ll be easy with him, sir?”</p>

<p>“My boy,” answered the Judge, looking just
a bit pompous and severe, “his case will be
judged absolutely on its merits. I can say no
more than that.”</p>

<p>After which, while the Clerk of the Court
coughed deprecatively in token that the Judge
was due on the bench, the Judge’s right eye-lid,
without in the least altering the expression of his
face, closed slowly down over the steel-gray eye.</p>

<p>Comforted, indeed rather happier than he had
been since yesterday afternoon, Jim passed into
the court room and took a seat at the rear. The
rest of the audience counted no more than two
dozen. Jim had never been in any sort of a court
before, and he was a little disappointed at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
almost casual way in which the cases were disposed
of. But the offenses were all minor ones
and so probably deserved little ceremony. The
Judge—strangely enough, Jim didn’t yet know
his name—sat very straight behind his desk and
looked unemotionally stern and gave his verdicts
in crisp, terse words. Jim began to be a little
uneasy. It seemed to him that the Judge was
absolutely unable to say “Discharged”! Instead,
it was “Ten days in jail” or “You are
fined fifty dollars” or “Sentenced to thirty days:
sentence suspended.” The prisoners were a dejected
looking lot until Webb Todd stood up in
his turn. Webb was perhaps more rumpled and
seedy-looking than his predecessors, but there
were no signs of dejection about him. Indeed he
had a rather jaunty air as he faced the Judge, in
spite of his unshaven face and cheap, skimpy,
frayed clothes. The Judge viewed him keenly
and at greater length than usual. The charge
was read.</p>

<p>“What have you got to say for yourself, Webster?”
asked the Judge.</p>

<p>“Not much, your Honor,” Webb answered
easily. “Just that I ain’t guilty. I’ve been here
three or four days looking for work, but I ain’t
a vagrant.”</p>

<p>“Where did you work last?”</p>

<p>“Manchester, New Hampshire, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“How long ago?”</p>

<p>“About a month. Nearly five weeks.”</p>

<p>“How did you happen to come here?”</p>

<p>“I was going to Norwalk. I got a job promised
me in Norwalk. I got out of money and I had
a friend here and I stopped to make a touch.”</p>

<p>“Succeed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“Yesterday afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Before that?” The Judge’s eyes bored hard.
Webb stroked his chin.</p>

<p>“A couple of days ago, sir.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you go to Norwalk when you got
the first money from this friend?”</p>

<p>“I—I guess I felt lazy,” said Webb. He smiled
engagingly, and the Judge frowned.</p>

<p>“Where’s your home?”</p>

<p>“New York City.”</p>

<p>“Ever been in Maine?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Four Lakes?”</p>

<p>Jim could see the sudden stiffening of Webb’s
thin form at the far end of the room. “Yes,
sir,” answered Webb after a moment.</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, Webster, that’s your
home, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It used to be, Judge. I—I guess I ain’t got
any now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>The Judge stared intently at Webb for a long
while across the desk, and, to his credit be it said,
Webb returned the look unflinchingly. “If I let
you off, Webster, will you promise me to leave
this town before night and secure work inside
of twenty-four hours?”</p>

<p>“I’ll say so, Judge.”</p>

<p>“Think you can secure work?”</p>

<p>“I know it.”</p>

<p>The Judge leaned back. “Discharged,” he
said. “Next case.”</p>

<p>Jim followed Webb into the corridor and went
down stairs with him. “Gee, I’m awfully glad,
Webb!” he said.</p>

<p>“Pshaw, he didn’t have nothin’ on me, kid.
What did I tell you? But, say, I forgot about
you seeing him, and when he asked me about Four
Lakes I got a swell jar! Did you bring the money,
kid?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You get what they took away from
you, Webb, and we’ll trade.”</p>

<p>Webb didn’t seem enthusiastic about that, but
he disappeared and after a few minutes returned
with his possessions. “Fifteen dollars,” he said,
offering Jim three five-dollar coins.</p>

<p>“Sixteen, forty-one,” said Jim implacably.
Webb sighed, grinned and found the balance.</p>

<p>“Gee, kid, you’re a regular Shylock, ain’t
you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“This isn’t my money, Webb. Remember that
I’ve got to pay back the difference, too.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. Say, I’m sorry, kid, honest I
am. I ain’t used you right, and I know it. Comin’
along to the railway station with me?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Jim. “I haven’t time, Webb.
Here’s five dollars. You’ll be able to eat for a
few days if you don’t get that job right off.”</p>

<p>“Kid, you’re a prince! But I’ll get the job, all
right. And say, this ain’t any promise, ’cause I
ain’t good at keeping promises, but maybe I’ll
be sending you that money back before long.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will,” replied Jim soberly. “Anyway,
I’ll be expecting you to, Webb, for you really
owe it to me, you know.”</p>

<p>“Help!” said Webb. “Well, that’s right, too.
So long, kid. See you again some day likely.”</p>

<p>They shook hands; they were at the corner now;
and Jim said: “You’ll keep your promise, won’t
you, Webb? I mean you’ll really go to Norwalk
and get work.”</p>

<p>“Take it from me, kid,” answered Webb, grinning,
“it ain’t going to be healthy for me in this
town after to-day. That Judge back there’s a
hard-boiled egg, or I miss my guess! So long,
kid!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>LOWELL IS WORRIED</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Too late for a ten o’clock recitation, Jim went
back to Haylow and deposited Clem’s money in a
drawer. At twenty minutes to eleven he went to
his last class of the day, and when he returned to
Number 15 Clem was there ahead of him. Jim
took the money from his drawer and laid it on
Clem’s chiffonier.</p>

<p>“That’s yours,” he stated.</p>

<p>Clem nodded carelessly. “Yes. Much
obliged.” Presently he arose and took the money
and placed it back in the suit-case, dropping the
bunch of keys back into the chiffonier drawer
as before. It is possible that the act was well intended.
Perhaps he meant to convey to Jim that,
despite what had happened, he still trusted him.
But Jim read it differently. To Jim the proceeding
announced: “You’ve been caught once, so I
guess you won’t try it again!” Since last night
the two had not had much to say to each other,
and what conversation there had been had
sounded lame. Probably in another day or two
the feeling of constraint on each side would wear
off, but just now it was far easier to remain silent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
than to make their remarks sound natural. After
a few minutes, though, Clem looked at his watch
and asked:</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going with the team, Jim?”</p>

<p>Jim started and hurriedly consulted his own
timepiece. “Gosh, yes!” he ejaculated. “I’d
forgotten!” He hustled about and finally made
for the door.</p>

<p>“Good luck,” said Clem. “Hope you trim
them.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” Jim called back.</p>

<p>There was an early dinner, at which Jim was
late, and then the squad piled into two buses and
were trundled to the station. New Falmouth was
not far, but the train was a slow one and, to-day,
was twenty minutes behind schedule besides. It
was well after two when they reached their destination.
Mr. Cade had taken twenty-six players,
and these with coaches, managers, trainer and
rubber made quite an addition to New Falmouth’s
population and caused considerable stir in the
little town.</p>

<p>The game started at three o’clock and went the
visitors’ way from the kick-off. New Falmouth
High School was a team that varied from very
good to extremely poor with the seasons. This
year it was an aggregation of big, husky youths
who seemed to have a lot of football inside them
but couldn’t get it out. That, at least, was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
way Lowell Woodruff put it to Jim on the way
home. Alton confined herself to straight plays
and had so little difficulty making ground through
the opponent’s line that she was not called on
to play an open game. Rolls Roice made the
first score when he picked up a fumbled ball
and dashed nearly thirty yards with it. Billy
Frost added a second touchdown six minutes later.
Pep Kinsey, who started the game at quarter,
kicked both goals and the first period ended with
Alton 14 and New Falmouth 0.</p>

<p>Mr. Cade began substitutions with the beginning
of the next quarter. Latham took Pep’s
place, Plant went in for Billy Frost and Benning
displaced Cheswick at center. A long march put
Alton on the home team’s eight yards where a
mistake in signals set her back to the fourteen.
Two drives by Tennyson, at full-back, netted five
and, with ten to go on fourth down, Latham tossed
to Levering, left end. But the ball grounded and
went to the enemy. It was not until the half was
nearly over that the Gray-and-Gold’s next invasion
yielded a profit. Then Plant broke
through from New Falmouth’s twenty-seven
yards and wormed through a crowded field to
the twelve. From there it took the visitors just
five plays to put the pigskin across, Tennyson
making the final plunge straight through center.
Whittier missed the goal. By that time Alton’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
line was largely composed of second and third
string players, and during the few minutes that remained
New Falmouth made her second first-down
and kept the ball in her possession.</p>

<p>Jim didn’t see service until the third period
started. His opponent was a big heavy youth,
but he was correspondingly slow, and Jim didn’t
have much trouble with him. Yet, somehow,
Jim played listlessly to-day. Usually he was surprisingly
quick after the ball, and had not infrequently
beaten his own ends down the field under
punts, but this afternoon he and the pigskin were
more like strangers and he was forever running
into the interference instead of around it. He
was not the only one who failed to show his best
form, however, for there was a noticeable let-down
in aggressiveness as the score grew. Mr.
Cade used every man he had brought along before
the end, but re-instated several first-string
fellows in the final period. Jim was one of those
who retired then. He didn’t much care, for some
reason. Perhaps, because when your side is 30
and the other side is 0, some of the zest of playing
is lacking.</p>

<p>New Falmouth made her single score while Jim
was still in as a result of abandoning her off-tackle
and around-the-end plays, which had netted
her little, and taking to a passing game. Twice
she tried long passes and failed, largely because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the thrower waited so long that Alton easily covered
the receivers. Finally, though, having
caught a short punt on Alton’s forty-seven yards,
she changed her tactics and used a short pass
across the line from a moving formation by which
the pass was well screened. Possibly she would
have found less success had the Gray-and-Gold
team not been at the time composed largely of substitutes.
As it was she managed to fool the opponents
very neatly by varying the passes with end
runs. Several times Alton’s back-field followed
across to the apparently threatened territory only
to find that a run had suddenly developed into a
forward pass that sent them doubling back, usually
too late. Once Smith, who had taken Gus
Fingal’s place, saved the day by pulling down the
receiver from behind. On three other occasions
New Falmouth got the pass to the runner almost
unchallenged, and only the fact that the receivers
seemed incapable of getting off quickly kept the
home team from crossing Alton’s goal-line. As
it was, New Falmouth swept from the forty-seven
to the fifteen, losing a yard now and then on end
plays and gaining from eight to twelve on passes
across the line.</p>

<p>On the fifteen-yard line, however, Alton, reinforced
by two first-string backs, stopped progress.
New Falmouth shot a forward to the left
only to have it knocked down by Billy Frost. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
plunge off tackle gained less than a yard. Faking
a try-at-goal, the invaders tossed over the
middle of the line and in the wild scramble that
ensued the pigskin again went to earth. With one
chance left New Falmouth put it up to the toe of
her full-back and, although Alton tried desperately
to break through, and although both Jim and
Hick Powers actually did succeed in almost reaching
the kicker, he made good and sent the pigskin
neatly between the uprights for New Falmouth’s
single score of the day. In revenge the visiting
team took the ball a few minutes later and,
strengthened by the return of many of her players
who had started the contest, walked down the
field for the last tally, sending Steve Whittier
over for the fifth touchdown just before time was
up. Steve added the 1 to the 6 a moment later,
and, since she had previously scored a field-goal,
Alton Academy returned home in the November
twilight with a 37 to 3 victory.</p>

<p>On the train Lowell Woodruff sat with Jim
and was very talkative on the subject of the contest
and the lessons to be learned from it. Jim,
feeling rather glum, would much rather have
watched the gray landscape and thought his
thoughts, even if they weren’t very cheering.
But he managed to make Lowell think he was attentive,
and, since Lowell never demanded too
much of his listeners, he had little opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
to commune either with Nature or with Jim Todd
during that forty-minute train ride. “We don’t
want to get proud and haughty about this game,”
was part of the wisdom imparted by the manager.
“Of course, it wasn’t so bad, and if we’d played
our best men all through we might easily have
scored a couple more times and kept our own
slate clean. But the point is that those raw meat
eaters back there are slow as cold molasses. And
their brains are sort of torpid, too. If they had
a chance to make a gain they went into conference,
you might say, and by the time they’d reached a
decision some one of our crowd spilled the beans.
I wouldn’t wonder if they had a pretty fair team
by the end of the season, but any fast bunch
could tie knots in ’em. That’s one thing we
showed ourselves to be to-day, Slim, fast. Yes,
sir, we’re plumb sudden the way we get started
and move around. And Johnny Cade was mighty
pleased, too. I guess there was a whole lot he
didn’t like, but the speed we showed had him
tickled to death. All we’ve got to do is keep up
the speed, work out a nice running and passing
game, and walk right away from Kenly Hall.”</p>

<p>“You think we can do it?” asked Jim, who, having
heard no more than half of Lowell’s remarks,
was driven by compunction to a show of interest.
Lowell grunted and looked past Jim into the
gathering darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think we can beat Kenly, but I don’t think
it the way I talked then,” he replied slowly.
“That’s the trouble with these easy games. They
make you see things that ain’t. Kenly licked the
boots off us two years ago and tied us last, and
I don’t see why she shouldn’t do it again. That
is, if we aren’t a hundred per cent better than we
were when she did it before. We’re some better
already, but we’re a long way from twice as good.
Kenly’s got most of her last year crowd on hand
again, and you know we’ve had to build almost a
new team. Anyway, I’d rather see Kenly win
than tie us. There’s something beastly unsatisfactory
about a game that neither side wins.
Seems as if all the season’s work and planning
had been wasted. It’s like a crazy dream I had
once. I dreamed I was climbing up a lot of ladders
hitched together at the ends. There were
dozens of ’em, and I kept on climbing, rung over
rung, scared blue all the time. And then when
I finally reached the top of the last ladder I was
just where I’d started!”</p>

<p>Jim laughed. Then: “Tie games never come
together, though,” he said knowingly. “I noticed
that when I was reading the football records the
other day.”</p>

<p>“I dare say that’s so,” said Lowell. “I think
we’ve only played three of them with Kenly since
the fun started. Anyway, I don’t want to see another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
one this year. How did you get on to-day?”</p>

<p>“All right, I guess,” answered Jim without
much conviction in his tones. “Not so well as
sometimes, maybe. Guess I didn’t feel very
zippy to start with.”</p>

<p>“I dare say. Every fellow has an off-day now
and then. Probably ate something. Take it easy
to-morrow and be good to yourself. You know,
Todd, I’m kind of banking on you to finish the
season strong. ‘Slim and Victory’s’ my motto!”</p>

<p>“Shucks,” muttered Jim. “I ain’t much good,
I guess.”</p>

<p>“That,” responded Lowell, “is just your modesty.
The fact is,” he added benignantly, “you
play your position just as I should if I were a
football man, Todd. I can think of no greater
praise!”</p>

<p>Jim was glad that he had a meeting of the
Maine-and-Vermont Society to interest him that
evening. Anything was preferable to sitting
alone in Number 15, and the companionship of
Clem offered even less attraction.</p>

<p>Clem had spent a dull afternoon. When it was
too late he wished that he had followed his first
impulse and journeyed to New Falmouth for the
game. After sitting listlessly in the room a while,
trying to write a letter and failing, trying to read
and again failing, he started downstairs with the
intention of finding some one who, like himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
had the afternoon on his hands. But the sight
of Mr. Tarbot’s open door produced a sudden impulse
and he stopped and knocked.</p>

<p>The instructor was at his desk, but he greeted
Clem cordially and asked him to sit down. Clem
seated himself in the attitude of one who has but
a moment to spare. “Mr. Tarbot,” he asked,
“did you notice a fellow pass your door yesterday
afternoon?”</p>

<p>“A fellow?” inquired the instructor, smiling.</p>

<p>“Well, a stranger, sir, sort of a smallish, thin
chap in gray, with a cloth cap; awfully seedy-looking.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t recall him,” replied Mr. Tarbot,
“but then so many go in and out, Harland, that I
pay very little attention.”</p>

<p>“If you’d seen this fellow I think you’d have
remembered him,” said Clem. “I mean you’d
have seen he wasn’t one of us, sir.”</p>

<p>“Probably. At least, I trust so. As a matter
of fact, Harland, I find myself as I grow older contracting
the odd habit of seeing things with my
eyes but not with my brain. For instance, had I
been facing the door when you went past I should
probably have raised my eyes and seen you quite
clearly, but if you asked me five minutes later if
I had seen you I’d have had to say no. So it isn’t
beyond possibility that your friend with the cloth
cap did go past here. I assume that my habit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
seeing without realizing is a natural and usual
symptom of approaching senility.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tarbot, although he looked somewhat
older, was still well under forty, and Clem
laughed. “Well, I guess you’d have noticed this
fellow,” he said. “He probably didn’t come
here.”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing wrong, I hope?” said the instructor.</p>

<p>Clem shook his head. Of course there was a
good deal wrong, but he couldn’t tell Mr. Tarbot
so. Outside, he felt at once disappointed and
satisfied; disappointed because, as thoroughly as
he disbelieved Jim’s version, he would have been
glad to find it true; satisfied because it is human
nature to relish confirmation of one’s convictions.
He spent the subsequent twenty minutes or so
trying to find an acquaintance with whom to cast
in his lot for the afternoon, but each room he
visited was deserted, and finally he went back to
Haylow and tried to make the best of the four
empty hours ahead.</p>

<p>Already Jim’s crime looked less heinous to
Clem. Of course, he assured himself, he could
never feel toward Jim quite as he had before, but
his first severity had waned. He even sought
excuses for the other. Probably Webb had
worked on Jim’s sympathies until the latter had
become desperate and on impulse, without sober<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
thought, had taken the only way to satisfy
Webb’s demand that was possible. Perhaps, he
told himself, even he, placed as Jim had been
placed, would have done the same. But he
couldn’t convince himself of that. And he was
certain that had he stolen that money he could
never have sought to escape suspicion by throwing
the blame on another. That, in Clem’s eyes,
was the deadliest sin.</p>

<p>He determined that so far as was possible he
would put the affair out of his mind and behave
as though nothing had ever happened. At least
for the rest of the term. Perhaps after Christmas
recess there would be a chance to move into
Lykes. Lykes was the senior dormitory and if
there was a vacancy he would be eligible for it.
Of course the matter of getting Jim into Janus
Society was at an end. Doubtless Jim would
understand that. Clem felt a little bit happier—and
perhaps a trifle heroic—after his decision,
and he was all prepared to carry his plan into
effect when Jim returned from the game. But
Jim went right from the station to supper and,
although Clem waited in Number 15 until nearly
eight o’clock, didn’t get back to the room until
ten. By that time Clem was feeling somewhat
disgruntled, as well as sleepy, and in the few
words that were exchanged constraint was as
much in evidence as ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>But the next morning Clem arose in a kindly
and even expansive mood. It was Sunday, there
was no work to be done and the sun was shining
brightly on the best of worlds. So he began
promptly to show Jim that everything was to be
just as it had been—almost—and sustained a distinct
surprise when Jim failed—or refused—to
read the signs. Jim was calm and polite, but he
was also brief and reserved. In fact, somewhat
to Clem’s indignation, Jim appeared to be trying
to swipe Clem’s rôle of Wounded Virtue! Hang
it all, Jim sounded as if it were his feelings that
had been outraged and hurt! Clem couldn’t make
it out, and after a few futile efforts to reëstablish
the former <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente</i> he relapsed into silence.
Oh, well, if the idiot didn’t appreciate his intentions
he could—could chase his blind aunt! He,
Clem, was through!</p>

<p>So, on the whole Sunday wasn’t a very merry
day in Number 15 Haylow, and the days that followed
weren’t much better save in so far as that
both Jim and Clem became gradually accustomed
to the estrangement as time passed. Clem sought
other companionship and seldom remained in the
room after supper and Jim redoubled his interest
in football and the affairs of the Maine-and-Vermont
Society. Perhaps it would be more
truthful to say that he sought to redouble his interest,
for he didn’t really succeed. In fact, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
wasn’t getting along so well on the gridiron these
days. The process of making a star tackle out of
Jim Todd appeared to have reached an end. By
the last of the week he seemed to have retired
permanently to the substitute status and even
Mulford filled in as often as he did. Lowell
Woodruff was puzzled and distressed. Lowell
liked to believe that he had in a manner discovered
Slim Todd; or that, if the actual discovery
wasn’t his, he had at least preserved it to the
world and established its value. He broached
the subject of Jim’s slump to Clem one evening.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what’s happened to the
blighter,” he said plaintively. “Up to a week or
so ago he was going great and Johnny was building
plays around him. But now look at the
blamed thing! He’s forgetting everything he
ever learned and a babe in arms could make him
look like a joke.” This was an exaggeration, but
Lowell dealt in exaggerations.</p>

<p>“I fancy,” answered Clem, plainly evasive,
“that he’s not feeling very fit, Woodie.”</p>

<p>“Fit my eye! He’s fit but he won’t fight!
Something’s taken all the pep out of him. Know
what it is?”</p>

<p>Clem shook his head. Lowell eyed him sharply
and said in pained tones: “You’re a liar, Clem.”</p>

<p>Clem blustered a little but Lowell refused to
retract. “Yes, you are,” he insisted. “But I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
suppose it’s something you can’t talk about, so
I’ll forgive you.”</p>

<p>“Better let it go at that,” said Clem, grinning.
“Anyway, I guess the team will survive without
Jim.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure. It would survive without any fellow
on the squad; even Gus; but that doesn’t mean we
want to lose a good, promising player, you old
coot, and if you know of any way of waking Jim
up out of his trance I wish to goodness you’d try
it. I’ve exhausted all my methods. When I talk
to him he just grins and nods and says, ‘Maybe
you’re right, Woodruff’ or ‘There’s nothing the
matter with me. You’ll see to-morrow.’ Well, I
look and I don’t see. Perhaps the chap has a secret
sorrow or—or something. Any of his folks
ill that you know of?”</p>

<p>Clem shook his head.</p>

<p>“How does he stand with the Office? Hear of
any trouble?”</p>

<p>“No, he’s all right there. He always is. He’s
a shark.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I give it up. Just one more good
man gone wrong, I suppose. But if you have any
influence—”</p>

<p>“I haven’t,” interrupted Clem shortly. “Let’s
drop it.”</p>

<p>So Lowell dropped it, but he wasn’t satisfied.
He retired from the conversation firmly convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
that Clem knew a heap more than he would acknowledge
and that if Clem was in any way responsible
for Jim’s deficiency boiling oil was far
too good for him.</p>

<p>On Wednesday Jim received a check for twelve
dollars from his father, cashed it at the Office
and laid the sum of ten dollars and fifty-nine
cents on Clem’s chiffonier. For some inexplicable
reason the finding of the money seemed to
annoy Clem, for he swept it into one hand and
fairly hurled it into the top drawer. Jim,
observing the strange action, made no comment.
You just couldn’t account for Clem’s behavior
and moods any more!</p>

<small>JIM DABBLES IN STRATEGY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>November was nearly a fortnight old and football
was fairly on the home-stretch. With the
New Falmouth game out of the way, Alton had
still to face Mount Millard, Oak Grove and Kenly
Hall, the first two at home, the latter at Lakeville.
Frosty nights and frequent chill and lowery
days had taken the place of October mildness,
and football enthusiasm, which, like the witch
hazel, only comes into full blossom after the tang
of frost is in the air, was rampant. Football
tunes were heard in the dormitories and wherever
two or more fellows were gathered together the
talk was of the team and of Kenly Hall’s warriors
and of the prospects of a Gray-and-Gold
victory. In short, it was the season of the year
when most normal American youths talk, think
and dream football.</p>

<p>Kenly Hall had won her five games with seeming
ease, rolling up large scores on three occasions,
and Alton scouts had returned to speak
with much respect of the Cherry-and-Black.
Those seeking light on the comparative merits
of Alton and Kenly had little to work on. Lorimer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Academy was the only adversary appearing
on the schedules of both. Alton had won from
Lorimer 6 to 0. Kenly had defeated Lorimer 27
to 6. From these scores a variety of conclusions
could be and were drawn. Pessimists pointed
gloomily to the fact that whereas Alton had been
able to put over but one touchdown against Lorimer,
Kenly had made four. Optimists dwelt on
the fact that although unable to cross Alton’s
goal-line Lorimer had found Kenly’s pregnable.
So there you were. Unlimited argument was possible.</p>

<p>Coach Cade and his assistants, though, had
more information to work on. To them it was
known that Kenly had a heavy, powerful team
which had developed early in the season and
which had yet to meet opposition strong enough
to thoroughly test it. Kenly’s line was strong,
if sluggish, and her backfield had weight and experience.
So far her backs had shown better
ability at plunging than at running plays, and
Kenly had won her battles largely on assaults inside
and outside tackles. If she had any running
game it had not been shown, and the same was
only slightly less true of her kicking. In short,
Kenly appeared to be standing pat on the style
of football played by her last year and the year
before; and for several years before that. She
was using a fairly well diversified attack inasmuch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
as she used short over-the-line passes inside
the opponent’s forty-yard line and pulled
off an end run, not often successfully, frequently
enough to keep the adversary in doubt. If the
Cherry-and-Black had one weakness it was in
the position of quarter-back. She had tried out
three men there and none had exhibited much
genius for generalship, although all had plenty of
skill as players. Coach Cade drew most satisfaction
from the fact that so far Kenly had persisted
along old lines and still showed no disposition to
upset his plans by introducing innovation.</p>

<p>On the Tuesday following the New Falmouth
game the second team, when it faced the first for
the first scrimmage of the week, discovered that
the opponent was using a new arrangement of the
backs. Quarter and one half-back stood five yards
behind the line of scrimmage, the former opposite
left tackle, the latter opposite the guard-tackle
hole on the right. The other half-back and the
full-back stood three yards behind the first two,
the first directly back of center and the second
directly back of the outside half. With this arrangement
every pass from center was necessarily
made straight to the runner and every member
of the back-field was eligible to take a forward
pass. There was no variation of the formation
save for drop—or place-kicking. The punting
was done by Whittier from approximately six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
yards behind the center. This necessitated getting
kicks off quickly, but Steve was equal to it.
The first team’s first punt from the new formation
so surprised the second team that the ball went
over the defensive back’s head!</p>

<p>Combined with line shifts of various sorts, the
new backfield formation showed more and more
merit as the season progressed. Plays in which
the back received the ball while moving seemed
especially adapted to it since speed was one thing
that the Gray-and-Gold backfield possessed.
Such plays demand extreme nicety in their execution
and following the New Falmouth game the
blackboard became a prominent feature in the instruction
and dummy drills a favorite occupation.
Evening sessions were held five times a
week and plays were set forth in diagram on the
blackboard and then walked through on the gymnasium
floor. A second volunteer coach had appeared
in the person of an old Alton player named
Lake, and to him fell the task of putting the final
polish on the backs. Football at Alton was now
running under forced draft.</p>

<p>Thursday, which would ordinarily have seen a
hard practice in preparation for Mount Millard,
was very nearly a wasted day, for a hard rain set
in about mid-morning and continued until long
after dark. The gridiron became a squashy,
soggy territory interspersed with miniature lakes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
by three o’clock, and so, although the afternoon
was to have been devoted to the perfecting of
several plays to be used on Saturday, the best
coaches and players could do was to hold a blackboard
party in the gymnasium. Five first-string
men were to go to Lakeville Saturday to watch
Kenly play Comerford and the players who were
to take their places were none too well drilled in
their rôles. Jim was one of the latter, for Rolls
Roice was included in the scouting expedition,
and he and George Mulford would both be called
on to fill in. Jim suspected that Mulford would
be Mr. Cade’s first choice, and the suspicion
didn’t worry him at all. Of course he would
rather play against Mount Millard than sit on the
bench, but whether he was put in at left tackle at
the start or only sent in as a substitute for Mulford
or Sawyer didn’t matter much to him. He
paid strict attention to the blackboard talk and
went through formations and signal drill afterwards
conscientiously enough, but his heart
wasn’t in it. The squad was dismissed early,
with instructions to report there again at seven-fifteen
for a night session, and Jim trailed back
to Haylow through the downpour to find, whether
to his relief or disappointment he couldn’t have
said, Number 15 empty.</p>

<p>He was up on his studies for Friday, and so he
tried to read a story in a magazine, stretching his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
long form on the window-seat and holding the
pages close to the pane in the dim white light.
But the story failed to win his interest, and after
a while he arose, found his rules book, a pad of
paper and a pencil and began to make lines and
circles and crosses. Lots of times, lying wakeful
in bed, Jim had concocted quite marvelous plays
in his mind. At least, they had seemed marvelous
at the time. Now he proposed to set them down
on paper and see what they really looked like.
It proved to be a most entertaining, even absorbing,
occupation. The plays he had figured out in
bed, or, at least, the few he could remember now,
weren’t at all startling when put to the test. Indeed,
few of them were original even to Jim, and
those that were transgressed some rule of play.
A perfectly gorgeous end-run looked like a world-beater
until it dawned on its inventor that it depended
for its effectiveness on the presence of a
back between tackle and end and that if the back
put himself there one of the other line-men would
have to drop out. But difficulties were made to
be overcome, problems to be solved, and as soon
as one diagram had been proved valueless Jim
tore off a sheet from the pad and began all over
again. When it was almost too dark to see he
heard Clem’s steps in the corridor and gathered
the discarded sheets up very quickly and stuffed
them in a pocket. He suspected that trying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
discover football plays not already discovered
was a puerile pursuit, and he didn’t want Clem to
catch him at it. What he did not have time to do,
however, before the door opened was to tear off
the top sheet of the pad on which he had just finished
the plan for a forward-pass. So he dropped
the pad face-down beside him, and when Clem entered
he was innocently gazing through the rain-washed
pane at the dripping trees and sodden turf
below.</p>

<p>“Hello,” said Clem. “Why the gloom?”</p>

<p>“Too lazy to get up,” replied Jim. Clem put
the lights on and viewed his room-mate curiously.
“Probably,” he had thought, “the poor duffer’s
sort of blue and lonesome.” And, being sorry,
he was prepared to “eat dirt,” if necessary, to
put things back on something like the old footing.
But Jim was thinking of the last play he had
fashioned. It had looked good to him, although
there had not been time to go over it thoroughly
after completion. He wished that Clem had delayed
his arrival by another five minutes; or
would take himself out again so that he could
study the new play at his leisure. Consequently,
when Clem looked for pathos in Jim’s face he
didn’t find it. Jim looked anything but lonesome
and unhappy. Sitting in the dark and staring out
onto a rain-drenched world, which would have
given Clem the dumps in no time, appeared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
have an animating, even cheering, effect on his
room-mate. Clem grunted as he turned to hang
up his cap.</p>

<p>“No practice to-day, I suppose,” he remarked,
returning to the table.</p>

<p>“Only indoors. What sort of a team does
Mount Millard have generally?”</p>

<p>“Fair to middling, I believe. Seems to me
they’ve beaten us once or twice. I think they
licked us in my freshman year. I forget, though.
Maybe it was the year before, and I just heard
talk of it. You playing Saturday?”</p>

<p>“Guess so. I’ll probably get in for a while.
Roice is going to Lakeville with three or four
other fellows to see Kenly Hall play.”</p>

<p>“I see.” Clem settled himself in a chair under
the light and began to read over a theme that
had been returned to him that morning, frowning
over the red-penciled criticisms that adorned the
margins. Surreptitiously Jim tore the top sheet
off the pad, folded it and consigned it to a pocket
for future reference. When supper time came
Clem showed no disposition to leave, so Jim went
to the lavatory first. There, finding it empty
for the moment, he disposed of soap and towel
and drew out the diagram and studied it for a
moment under the light. He was still so occupied
when footfalls beyond the swinging doors caused
him to thrust the paper hurriedly from sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
again. The arrival proved to be Clem, but Jim
didn’t take the paper out again. He washed and
went back to the room for his cap and was soon
on his way to Lawrence Hall and supper. In
other times he and Clem had always gone together,
but now they carefully avoided doing that.
Sometimes the avoidance resulted in quite embarrassing
situations; as when, a night or so before,
Clem had started off first only to stop in the
lower corridor to talk to an acquaintance and Jim
had come down just as Clem and the other chap
were parting. Jim had had to retrace his steps
to the mail-boxes and search for a letter he knew
wasn’t there.</p>

<p>At supper he asked a question of Jake Borden,
the right end, who sat beside him. “How do they
make up these plays they use, Jake?” Jim inquired.</p>

<p>“What plays?” asked Jake.</p>

<p>“Any of them. Like that end-around play the
second sprung yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that one’s as old as the hills,” replied
Jake contemptuously, helping himself to a third
piece of toast. “So old we weren’t expecting it.
Going to use your butter, Slim?”</p>

<p>Jim pushed it over. “Well, who do you suppose
thought of it? And—and how?”</p>

<p>“Search me! Some one’s always springing
new ones. It isn’t hard to make ’em up, but only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
one in a dozen amount to anything. A play may
look great on a blackboard and not amount to a
row of pins when you try it out against another
team.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. I guess there are lots of them,
too.”</p>

<p>“A couple of hundred, probably. Whose apricots
are those, Pep?”</p>

<p>“Mine. Want ’em?”</p>

<p>When the dish of stewed fruit had reached Jake
and been sampled he resumed. “I don’t suppose
there’s any limit to the different plays that could
be invented. Of course, most of them would be
a whole lot like a whole lot of others, and not many
of them would be—er—practicable, but just consider
that you’ve got, say, four backs and two linemen
who can carry the ball and that there are
eight holes for them to go through. There you’ve
got forty-eight straight plays right off the reel.
Then you’ve got all sorts of forward-passes,
punts, drops and placements: maybe another
twenty-five or thirty. And you haven’t started
on fakes and tricks at all yet! Two hundred?
I’ll bet there are three hundred already! And all
over this benighted land Smart Alecks are sitting
up with paper and pencils trying to dope out
more. It’s a fearsome thought, if you ask me.”</p>

<p>“I suppose all the good plays have been used,
anyway, by this time,” reflected Jim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know. No, I don’t believe so.
Besides, the Rules Committee sees to that. Just
as soon as there aren’t any more nut plays to
spring on us poor players the Committee changes
the rules and the parlor strategists start all over
again. And then there’s this forward-pass, Slim.
That’s got all sorts of possibilities that haven’t
been—what you might call developed yet. Last
year folks thought there wasn’t anything new
under the sun and two or three wild western
coaches had brain-storms and showed the eastern
guys how they’d been asleep at the switch. You
know, Slim, it takes those western chaps to spring
the new stuff. If it wasn’t for them we fellows
back here in the effete east would still be thinking
the criss-cross the absolute knees plush ultra
of trick football!”</p>

<p>“What are you fellows gassing about so earnest-like?”
inquired “Tip” Benning from across
the table.</p>

<p>“Football plays,” answered Jake. “I was saying
that if it wasn’t for the fellows out west we’d
still be doddering along with the delayed pass
and the good old criss-cross. They’re the guys
who give us the new stuff.”</p>

<p>“How do you get that way?” demanded Billy
Frost derisively. “Who invented the unbalanced
line, for instance?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, who invented the shift? And what
about the pass to moving back? And—”</p>

<p>“All right! What about the concealed pass?
I suppose Harvard sent west for that? And what
about Cornell’s—”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you one play the west did invent,”
interrupted Latham, “and that’s the concealed
ball trick! It took an Indian to spring that, and
if Indians aren’t Westerners—”</p>

<p>“Listen! Who was coaching the Indians that
year?” demanded Billy Frost.</p>

<p>“How do I know? I wasn’t born, I guess!”</p>

<p>“Well, it was a man named Warner. Maybe
you’ve heard of him?”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of two Warners,” laughed Latham.
“One of ’em makes speedometers.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll bet that Indian would never have
thought of hiding the ball under his jersey. It
was the coach pulled that one. And, anyway, it
was against the rules.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, it wasn’t! Not then. Anyhow, the
Indians won the game with it!”</p>

<p>“Come to that,” some one else broke in, “Glenn
Warner’s a Westerner, anyway, isn’t he? Didn’t
he go to Cornell?”</p>

<p>“What of it?” asked Jake. “Say, where do
you think Cornell is?” The first speaker had to
acknowledge that he had confused it with Kenyon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and while Coach Cade, at the farther end of
the long table, was being appealed to to locate
Kenyon College, Jim left the board.</p>

<p>Back in his room he settled down to study that
forward-pass play again. He had told himself,
coming back from Lawrence, that there was probably
nothing in it, or, if there was, the play had
long since been evolved. Still, however, Jake
Borden had distinctly stated that the forward-pass
still held unthought of possibilities, and so
it was barely possible—</p>

<p>Right there his reflections were rudely disturbed
by the fact that his precious diagram was
not where he had placed it. Nor was it in any
other pocket. All he could find were the several
crumpled sheets of paper he had thrust from
sight before Clem’s arrival. Probably he had
failed to put in safely back in his vest pocket
in the lavatory and it had fallen out. He tore
the discarded diagrams into minute pieces and
placed them well at the bottom of the waste-basket.
Then he proceeded to redraw his forward-pass
play.</p>

<p>When it was again accomplished he tried to
find its weak points. He made certain by repeated
reference to the rules book, now pretty well worn
and parting from its covers, that he had not violated
any of the twenty-eight mandates, and after
that he viewed it from the enemy’s side. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
end he decided that the play was perfectly legal
and that it was capable of success, but those facts
made him doubly suspicious of its originality, and,
after admiring it for some time and speculating
about it and trying to improve it, he crumpled
the paper up and dropped it, too, into the basket.
He guessed he was no football strategist.</p>

<p>On Friday, although the gridiron was still
soggy and slippery under a cloudy sky, the squad
held outdoor practice for two full hours. Two
very full hours indeed, Jim thought. With half
the first-string players on the bench, the big team
met the second for thirty strenuous minutes and
failed to score in spite of the fact that three
coaches bellowed and thundered, threatened and
implored. Twice the first reached the second
team’s ten-yard line and twice it was forced to
yield the ball. Field-goals were not in Mr. Cade’s
philosophy this afternoon, and so that means of
scoring was denied. However, even though the
second was time and again given an extra down,
it was equally unable to pass its opponent’s
goal-line, and the wearied and somewhat disgruntled
first team players derived some satisfaction.
After a five-minute rest a team of substitutes
was run out and the first eleven, somewhat
changed, was sent against it with instructions
to use only forward-passes. There was ten
minutes or so of that added insult, during which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Jim, without really trying and without knowing
it, somewhat distinguished himself as the receiving
end of several tosses, Kruger, playing right
end, being shifted to the other side of the line at
such times and leaving Jim eligible. It was almost
too dark to see the ball when Jim made his final
catch of a long heave toward the side-line that
netted a good eighteen yards to the first, and that
play ended the work. In the evening there was
an hour of drill in the gymnasium followed by a
brief quiz by the coach. And then, on Saturday,
Mount Millard came charging down on Alton, with
most of her students in the line of march that
wound through town from the station, and when
Josh Plant, down to play right half in place of
the absent Billy Frost, glimpsed the team as it
romped away from the gymnasium he turned
strickenly to Steve Whittier and grasped his
hand.</p>

<p>“Tell them,” he said tremulously, “that I died
game, fighting against tremendous odds!”</p>

<small>ALTON MEETS WITH DISASTER</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The Gray-and-Gold presented a line-up that
afternoon that lacked the names of four of its
best players. Smith was at right guard in place
of Captain Gus Fingal, Mulford played left tackle
in place of Roice, Plant substituted Frost at right
half and Barnhart ran the team. It was still a
moot question whether Kinsey or Latham was
first-choice quarter-back, but Barnhart was undeniably
third-choice, and to-day, in the absence of
both the others, he was faced by a stiff proposition.
As Josh Plant had intimated, the visitors
were a fine, sturdy looking lot, and they outsized
Alton both in the line and the backfield. That
they would score was a foregone conclusion.
Whether Alton would score, too, was problematic.
Watching the visitors perform during the brief
warming-up session, many Alton partisans were
flat-footed in the assertion that Coach Cade had
erred in weakening his team as he had.</p>

<p>Before the first half was well along it had become
evident that nothing save a miracle could
save the home team from defeat. And miracles,
as we all know, as often as they are longed for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
seldom happen on the football field. Mount Millard
found a soft place in the Alton line early in
the game and pounded Smith for repeated gains.
Varying attacks at right guard with off-tackle
plays, the visitors rushed from their own thirty-five-yard
line to Alton’s twenty-eight. There
Cooper was sent in for Smith and two tries at
the new incumbent gained but four yards and
Mount Millard shot a forward-pass to the twelve
yards. Levering was caught napping and Whittier
reached the receiver too late to spoil the catch.
Steve did the next best thing, however, and threw
the enemy hard on the ten-yard line. Mount Millard
wasted a down in an attempt to carry the ball
out-of-bounds, missing by inches. Faking a similar
attempt, she got three outside of tackle on
the other side and landed the ball on the seven
yards. Here an off-side penalty put her back to
the twelve and she faked a try-at-goal that turned
out to be a plunge inside tackle. Mulford was
put out neatly and a Mount Millard back crashed
through to the five-yard line. Scorning a fairly
certain three points, the enemy tried a complicated
cross-buck which, since the play had all the
ear-marks of a forward-pass, nearly won her a
touchdown. It failed, though, by a half-yard and
Whittier punted on first down from behind his
goal. Catching on Alton’s thirty-eight, the visitors
started a second advance but lost the ball<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
near the twenty-five just before the quarter ended.</p>

<p>At the resumption of hostilities Alton tried
hard to get her attack going, but twice the enemy
broke through and stopped the runner for a loss,
and after an end-run had been spilled for a two-yard
gain Whittier booted the ball. A fumble
by the Mount Millard quarter was recovered for
a ten-yard loss and the enemy put the ball in play
on her thirty. She made it first down on her
forty-three and crossed the middle of the field
in two plays by her full-back. Her next attempt
was stopped, however, and, with one to go, she
tried a long forward-pass that was intercepted by
Tennyson. The Alton full-back fought his way
for eight yards before he was thrown. A moment
later it was Tennyson who found a hole to his
liking on the left of the Mount Millard line and
plunged through for seven yards more. A second
attempt by the same player failed to gain
and it was Plant who made it first down. Two
slams at the line netted but three yards and Whittier
tossed across the right of the line to Levering
who, although pulled to earth promptly, secured
all but a few feet of the needed distance.
Tennyson piled over the center for the rest. But
what looked like an Alton invasion stopped on the
enemy’s thirty-seven and Whittier punted.
Those kicks from close behind the line found
Mount Millard unprepared for a while, and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
this occasion the quarter again fumbled. A team-mate
saved the day, though, and reeled off twelve
yards through a crowded field before he was finally
run out. After that the play hovered about
the middle of the field until, just before the end of
the half, the Mount Millard left half got away inside
Sawyer, at right tackle, and zigzagged toward
the Alton goal in a breath-taking fashion for some
thirty yards. It was Whittier who finally pulled
him down near the twenty.</p>

<p>This was Mount Millard’s second chance to
score, and now she had no intention of being denied.
Really exceptional football was played
by the visitors then, and the Alton line broke time
and again before desperate attacks. The Mount
Millard full-back was the star of that skirmish,
making gains of four and five and six yards at
a time. The right of the Alton line was weakened
by the absence of Captain Fingal, just as Mount
Millard had probably surmised it would be, and
it was at the right that most of the gains were
made. Alton stiffened on her four yards and gave
grudgingly, but the enemy finally piled across,
beating the whistle by a matter of seconds only.
An easy goal followed, and Alton retired from the
field with seven points scored against her.</p>

<p>Jim had his chance when the third quarter
started, and, while he played a steadier game than
had Sawyer, Mount Millard still found the Alton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
right side vulnerable when a short gain was
needed. Cooper, playing in Captain Gus’s position,
proved no better than Smith, and when, toward
the close of the period, he began to show the
effects of the attention given him by the enemy
backs he was taken out and Smith was reinstated.
The Alton rooters expected that their team would
show some of the new plays that had been drilled
into it during the past fortnight and momentarily
looked for Whittier or Plant to get clear and put
the game on an even basis. But the few plays
didn’t materialize. Save for the new formation,
which had its defamers on the Alton stand, the
Gray-and-Gold showed nothing it had not shown
before during the season. Even the nine forward-passes
attempted in the course of the contest
lacked novelty, and the running plays which Alton
was supposed to have been perfecting were
not exhibited. Alton was handicapped by the lack
of a really first-class quarter, for Barnhart, while
a hard-working, snappy youth, lacked experience
sadly. His choice of plays were frequently more
than questionable and he seemed unable to inspire
his team. Yet in the final period he came
near to atoning for all shortcomings when he shot
out of what seemed an inextricable tangle of Alton
backs and ends and skirted the enemy’s wing
for sixty-two yards. It was the Mount Millard
quarter who brought him down on the seventeen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
yards just when the shouting Alton rooters were
visioning a touchdown. One unlucky stumble
spelled Barnhart’s doom and Alton’s defeat.
Had he not stumbled and momentarily lost his
stride just before the enemy quarter sprang for
him he would undoubtedly have gone on over the
line, for Whittier was protecting him in the rear
from the foremost of the Mount Millard pursuers.
On such small things may Victory hinge!</p>

<p>Barnhart called for a smash at the left that
sent Tennyson over the side-line and when the
ball had been walked in he sent Whittier sliding
off tackle at the right for six yards, and the Alton
stand whooped it up deliriously. But when Steve
went back to kicking position as the ball was
snapped the enemy was not fooled and Tennyson’s
dash around the right was nipped for a two-yard
loss. Barnhart and Whittier, the latter captain
pro tem, held a consultation then. The fourth
period was young and there was still time to
score again if the present venture failed. Barnhart
wanted the three points a field-goal would
bring, but Steve was firm for everything or nothing
and Steve’s word carried. So Steve went
back to drop-kicking position, and Cheswick
passed the ball to him. It looked as though Jake
Borden, well over to the left and sidling across
the goal-line, was well uncovered, yet between
the time that Steve shot the ball away to him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the instant it arrived a Mount Millard man
dropped from the sky, or so it seemed, and smote
the pigskin fairly out of Borden’s hands.</p>

<p>That ended Alton’s threat. For the rest of the
game the enemy played it safe, punting and punting
again while the Gray-and-Gold sought desperately
to again reach scoring distance. Toward
the end play slowed up sadly for Alton,
Barnhart seemingly at a loss and confusing his
signals more than once. Cheswick gave way to
Tip Benning and Levering to Tate in the line.
Fillmore took Tennyson’s place and Adams and
Ness became the halfs. But even fresh men
couldn’t stave off defeat, and finally the game
came to an end with the home team fairly at a
stand-still on her forty-five.</p>

<p>That evening Alton, saddened by the defeat,
took second thought. Reference to Mount Millard’s
record for the season somewhat eased the
pain, for the big team had six victories to its
credit, four of them against most worthy adversaries.
Consequently, it was fair to assume that
Alton, deprived as she had been of her captain
and best quarter-backs, to say nothing of the other
absentees, had done not so badly after all. Of
course a defeat was a defeat, but it need not
necessarily be a disgrace, and by Sunday Alton
as a whole had reached the cheering decision that
her team had performed very creditably. In support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
of this contention it was rumored that
Johnny Cade had shown signs of satisfaction both
during and subsequent to the battle. This, however,
was only hearsay. In any event, Alton was,
it was universally acknowledged, to be congratulated
on one thing. She had gone through the
Mount Millard game without once showing the
hand she was holding for Kenly. Not a single
new play had been used. Even the line shifts
had been no different. To be sure, Coach Cade
had shown the half-dozen Kenly scouts who had
openly invaded the Mount Millard stands his
new backfield formation, but since he had used it
as the basis for only the most ordinary, time-honored
plays it was held to be doubtful that the
enemy observers would derive much profit from
seeing it. Rather oddly—not so oddly, either, if
you know human nature—those who now expressed
the most pleasure over the withholding
of new plays were those who had during the game
most vigorously denounced Coach Cade for not
using them.</p>

<p>Jim derived little satisfaction from his playing
in the Mount Millard contest. He could, he decided,
boast of a cut cheek and two fingers of his
left hand bandaged together, but of little else.
In retrospect it seemed to Jim that he had played
like a loon. He had missed interference more
often than he cared to think of, he had twice allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the big Mount Millard guard, who faced
him on offense, to get under him and spill him on
his face and he had several times failed to open
the hole he was expected to. Jim felt extremely
depressed whenever he reviewed his activities
of that afternoon, failing to take into account,
unlike one or two of his team-mates, the fact that
Mount Millard had presented a far better opposition
than Alton had hitherto experienced.</p>

<p>It rained on Sunday; one of those desultory,
half-hearted rains that seem always on the point
of letting up, and don’t; and Jim’s spirits became
as gloomy as the view from the windows of
Number 15. He told himself that it would have
been a lot better if he had stuck to the decision
he had made last fall and kept firmly away from
football. The first rift in the clouds didn’t appear
until Monday morning. Then the glint of
sunshine that peered through wasn’t very bright.
When Jim looked in the letter-box on his way to
breakfast he found a letter postmarked at Norwalk.
It was a brief and frequently misspelled
missive from Webb Todd from which fell a soiled
and flabby two-dollar bill. Webb reported that
he was working, though the wages weren’t much—Jim
thought four dollars and a half a day quite
fabulous!—and that he was well and hoped this
would find Jimmy the same, and he was sending
two dollars. There was more, but this was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
gist of it. It was enough to cheer Jim up a little,
for he had a genuine affection for Webb, and life
didn’t look quite so dark afterwards.</p>

<p>Practice was light that Monday afternoon and
there was no visit from the second. The only hostilities
that developed were between the first team
and the substitutes, and they lasted only ten minutes
and were used by the coaches to illustrate
the mistakes made on Saturday. On the bench
it was confidentially noised that Gus and the
others who had gone over to Lakeville Saturday
had returned primed with all sorts of invaluable
information, and strong in the belief that Kenly
had something big up her sleeve that wouldn’t
slip into sight before the big game. Kenly, it
seemed, had toyed with her opponent, using two
full teams in the process of running up a 41 to 0
score, and had showed nothing she didn’t want to.
What information the Alton scouts had brought
back was mainly concerned with the individual
performances of the Kenly players, although certain
other features had not escaped their eyes.
The general verdict to-day was to the effect that
“Kenly has a strong team, all right, but we can
lick ’em!”</p>

<p>The usual evening session in the gymnasium
came off as usual at seven-thirty, and Coach Cade,
chalk in hand, drew diagrams on the blackboard
and explained them, after which the plays were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
walked off. Some of the plays were fairly complicated,
and to-night the class seemed duller than
usual. Perhaps for that reason Mr. Cade shortened
the session. Having, however, released
them, he called them back in the next breath.</p>

<p>“Just a minute, fellows!”</p>

<p>The exodus halted short of the doors. Mr.
Cade was holding a sheet of paper up.</p>

<p>“Does this belong to any one here?” he asked.</p>

<p>Some of the nearer fellows retraced their steps
for a closer view, while a voice from further away
asked: “What is it, Mr. Cade?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a sheet of paper,” was the answer.
“It was found somewhere, in one of the dormitories,
I think, and handed to me. It has a football
play on one side, done in pencil, and—”</p>

<p>Laughter met that announcement. Mr. Cade
smiled, too, but he went on to add: “I understand
your amusement, but it happens that this play
strikes me as rather ingenious and novel. Certainly,
I don’t remember ever having seen it in
use. That’s why I want to find the fellow who
drew it. I’d like to ask him where he found it.”</p>

<p>By this time most of the squad had clustered
around, but no one laid claim to the paper. There
was a good deal of laughter and speculation, but
in the end the coach refolded the sheet and placed
it back in his pocket and the fellows crowded out,
bandying joking explanations, such as that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
thing had been “planted” by the enemy. Mr.
Cade left the floor some moments after the players,
accompanied by Lowell Woodruff. They
walked together as far as the corner of Borden
Hall, and there Lowell turned off along the walk
and the coach started across the campus on a bee-line
for the main gate. Footfalls made scarcely
any sound on the turf and consequently the coach
gave a start of surprise when a voice called to
him from hardly more than a yard behind. He
wheeled quickly and found a tall figure at his
elbow.</p>

<p>“Mr. Cade, that piece of paper was mine. I
lost it somewhere two or three days ago.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s Todd! Yours, you say? Well, why
didn’t you claim it, Todd?”</p>

<p>Jim hesitated an instant. “Well, sir, you see
I thought those fellows would rag me if they
knew.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cade laughed. “I see,” he said. “Well,
where did you get hold of this idea, Todd?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know? What do you mean by that?
You got it somewhere, of course. Did you find
it in a book or in a paper? Ever seen it used?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, what I mean is—well, I just <em>thought</em>
of it.”</p>

<p>“Made it up yourself, you mean? Are you sure
of that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I’ve never seen any of those plays
in books, Mr. Cade, and I haven’t seen many
games, either. Maybe it ain’t new, of course. I—I
was just sort of amusing myself.”</p>

<p>“No, the chances are that it isn’t new. Mighty
few plays are. But it’s new to me, Todd, and it
might be new to—” He broke off. Then: “Are
you going to be busy this evening?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not all evening,” answered Jim. “I’ve got
about an hour’s studying to do, but after that—”</p>

<p>“It’s a little after eight. Can you drop over
and see me about nine or a few minutes later?
You know where I live?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I know. I’ll come.”</p>

<p>“Good enough. I’d like to talk to you about
this. And, if you don’t mind, I’ll keep it until I
see you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Jim watched the dark form of the coach vanish
into the gloom of the trees and then turned
and made his way back to Haylow. He felt rather
excited, rather elated. Suppose— No, he
wouldn’t suppose anything—yet! Probably it
was all just nothing at all. Maybe Mr. Cade
hadn’t really looked at the diagram yet. Maybe—</p>

<p>That and a few more “maybes” brought Jim
to Number 15 and the sight of Clem studying at
the table. He wished he could tell Clem about
the momentous happening. But he couldn’t.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
And he mustn’t think about it any more now.
There was Latin to be dug into. Very determinedly
he seated himself opposite the absorbed
Clem and drew his books toward him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>THE REVERSE PASS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Mr. Cade answered Jim’s ring and led the way
into the big, comfortable sitting-room, where, observing
no appropriate accommodation for caps,
Jim disposed of his own by putting it in his
pocket. Then he took a chair close to the big
round table that held a huge lamp, magazines and
books and ash-trays and battered pipes and a
strange but interesting litter of other things, and
Mr. Cade dropped back into his leather arm-chair,
took up the diagram and studied it for a moment
in silence. During the moment Jim looked around
him, felt the somewhat out-at-elbows hominess of
the room and relaxed against the frayed cushions
behind him.</p>

<p>“As I make out this reverse pass, Todd,” said
the coach, “it’s a good scoring play under certain
conditions—<em>if</em> it proves practical. Its weakness
lies in the fact that three passes are involved.
Every pass depends primarily for its success on
two players, the man who throws and the man who
receives. If either one fails the pass fails. This
play consequently offers a bigger chance for failure
than the play calling for two passes. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
other hand its principal feature, which is that
of deception, seems to me to justify the added
risk. Now, suppose you explain it to me, Todd.”</p>

<p>“Explain it?” faltered Jim.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’d like to get your version of it. It’s
your idea, and I want to learn just what that
idea is. What I make of this sketch may not be
what you had in mind.”</p>

<p>“Well,” began Jim, leaning forward to refresh
his memory from the diagram in the other’s
hand, “it uses the regular back-field formation.”</p>

<p>“Yes, so I see, but what about the line? You
can’t see this from there, can you? Suppose you
bring your chair nearer.”</p>

<p>“I’ll just sort of draw it over,” said Jim. He
looked about for paper and, seeing none, thrust
a hand into the inner pocket of his jacket.</p>

<p>“What do you want? Paper? Wait, there’s
some here somewhere.” Mr. Cade started to rise
but Jim had found what he was after. He always
carried three or four old letters or similar documents
and now he selected one and pulled out his
fountain pen.</p>

<p>“This will do, sir,” he said. “Maybe if I can
see that plan a minute—” Mr. Cade handed it
to him and he made a hurried copy of it on the
back of a folded letter. Then he began again,
clearing his throat portentously. “You move
your right guard and tackle to the other side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
sir, and bring your left end over. That gives
you two ends on the right of your line.” Mr.
Cade nodded thoughtfully. “Your left half-back—or
whoever stands behind the center—gets the
ball on a direct pass and— Hold on, though, I
forgot. First, this fellow here—”</p>

<p>“Let’s call them by name, Todd. Here’s Kinsey
at the left, here’s Frost at the right, this is
Tennyson behind Frost, and this is Whittier directly
back of the center. All right. Now you
were going to say that Tennyson—what?”</p>

<p>“He starts before the ball, sir, running to the
left. That—that’s all right, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely, as long as he runs toward his
goal-line as well as to the left. That is, a back
may be moving when the ball is put in play so
long as he is taking a course which at some time
or other would cause him to intersect an extension
of his own goal-line. Not very lucid, but go on.”</p>

<p>“Well, he runs to the left, passing behind Whittier
and going over here.”</p>

<p>“Where is ‘over here,’ Todd?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly, sir. I suppose about
twelve yards back of the scrimmage line and
maybe about five yards outside the end.” He
looked questioningly across and the coach nodded
again.</p>

<p>“Something that can be best determined by experiment,
I fancy. Then what?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>“Center passes to Whittier and Whittier holds
the ball as if to throw it, but he goes back and to
the left until he gets here, about half-way between
where he was and where Tennyson is. Then he
makes a short pass, a sort of a toss—”</p>

<p>“Which must be on-side,” interpolated the
coach.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, not a forward-pass. He tosses the
ball to Tennyson. I forgot to say, though, that
he ought to be always facing to the left after he
gets the ball from center, sort of making like he
means to pass to the left across the end of the
line.”</p>

<p>“Why?” demanded Mr. Cade.</p>

<p>“So as to make the other fellows, the other
team, move that way. You see, sir, the idea is to
draw the other players to their right.”</p>

<p>“I see, but if Whittier emphasizes the intention
to throw to his left, won’t the opponents argue
that his real intention is a heave in the other
direction?”</p>

<p>Jim studied a moment. “Well, maybe they
would, sir,” he said finally. “Maybe he’d better
not do that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he should overdo it, anyway,
Todd. He might defeat his own ends and make
the opposing backs cover the left side of their territory.
Anyway, the real deception comes when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
he passes to Tennyson. That makes it look like
an end-run for the moment. Now go on.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, Tennyson passes to the right, just
about over the center of the line, to the right
end.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cade frowned over the diagram in his hand.
“How does that end get into position, Todd?”</p>

<p>“He blocks the opposing end until Whittier
has the ball and has started back with it. Then
he lets the end through and goes on down about
ten yards and pretty well over toward the side.”</p>

<p>“Question is whether Frost couldn’t do that
part better, Todd. You’re counting on the opposing
backs swinging to their right and not coming
around our right end, but I don’t believe you can
do that. Wouldn’t the end be in better position
than Frost to put out a back coming around? But
never mind that for the moment. What’s Kinsey’s
duty?”</p>

<p>“I thought he’d block off the outside back on
our left until Tennyson made the throw. Then
Whittier, after he has passed to Tennyson, guards
him on the inside in case one of the other side
gets through. And I’d figured it that the right
end would just block long enough to keep the opposing
end, or, maybe, a tackle, from spoiling the
play and then he’d go down for the catch. He’d
sort of take it easy, too, like the play wasn’t on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
his side and he was out of it. Then Frost there
would take care of a back in case one tried to
slip around that side.”</p>

<p>“Sounds fairly reasonable, too,” mused the
coach. “One thing, though, won’t do, Todd.
You’ve got all your heavy men on the left of center
and both ends on the right. Now ends mean
speed, and when the opponents see two ends on
one side they’re going to smell a mouse. They’re
going to suspect the play, whatever it is, is coming
on that side, and they’re going to stick around
a while. Of course you need the strong side of the
line in front of the play, but perhaps you don’t
need all the strength you’ve put there. You could
leave a tackle and end on the right, or even a
guard and end, I fancy, which wouldn’t cause so
much suspicion on the part of the enemy. Or—”
Mr. Cade stopped, thrust out a lower lip and
lifted a speculative glance to Jim. “Or, much
better yet, Todd, you could simply move your end
to the other side.”</p>

<p>“Then who would take the pass, sir? You mean
let Frost get it?”</p>

<p>“Not necessarily. The last man on that side
of the line would be eligible.”</p>

<p>“Well, but—but you’ve got to have a fellow
who can catch forward-passes, Mr. Cade,” said
Jim earnestly. “That’s a long pass, nearly
forty-five yards, maybe, and it would need a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
mighty good fellow to catch it. That’s why I
thought it ought to be Jake Borden.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Borden’s pretty good,” agreed the coach.
“But that’s another part that can be decided
later. The first thing we’ve got to do is try this
out in actual play and see whether it goes the
way it looks on paper. It ought to, but you can’t
tell. If it ever did get pulled off just right in a
game, Todd, it would be a whaling ground-gainer.
The start of this play ought to draw the whole
opposing team to our left, and once there they’d
never get back again to the other side of the field
to prevent a catch. In fact, it wouldn’t be surprising
if the man who received that ball found
a clear path to the goal-line. In any case he’d
be certain of ten yards, even if he didn’t stir
after the catch. By Jingo, Todd, I like the thing,
I honestly do!”</p>

<p>“I wish it would go like I—like it looks
like—” Jim got tangled there, and before he
could get straightened out and go on Mr. Cade
was speaking again.</p>

<p>“Of course the play has its limitation, Todd.
As, for instance, it couldn’t be used if the ball
was very close to either side-line. Wait, though!
That’s wrong. It could be pulled off all right
pretty close to the right side of the field, couldn’t
it? Todd, I’m going to sit up with this thing
to-night and figure it out!” He was staring at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the diagram again. Then: “Thunder, here’s another
bad feature! Look here, Todd. About the
time when Tennyson gets set to make that forty
or forty-five yard heave he’s going to have in the
neighborhood of sixteen men dodging around between
him and the receiver. Well, that means
that it’s going to be mighty hard for him to sight
his man. Of course he can throw the ball to a
certain specified spot across the field, trusting
Borden or some one to be there— That reminds
me.” Mr. Cade added another memorandum to
those he had already jotted on the side of the paper
he held. “It might be possible to make this a
two-man pass. How about Frost? I wonder if
we could fix it so as to put him over there with
Borden in time to make the catch or to interfere.”</p>

<p>Jim studied his plan and looked dubious. “I
don’t believe so, sir. Besides, wouldn’t it be sort
of a give-away if two fellows went over there?
One might look like an accident, but two—”</p>

<p>“I fancy you’re right. Well, we’ll see.” Mr.
Cade laid the diagram aside and picked up his
pipe. “I wish you’d tell me something, Todd,”
he said. “You started out like a comer and I had
great hopes of you. You went finely until a week
or so ago, two weeks, perhaps; then you laid down
on us. What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know, Mr. Cade,” answered Jim.
“I guess there isn’t anything the matter. I mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
I don’t know why I can’t seem to play like I used
to.”</p>

<p>“Lost interest?”</p>

<p>Jim hesitated. “N-no, sir, not exactly.”</p>

<p>“That means you have. Why? Feeling all
right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, fine.”</p>

<p>“Anything worrying you?”</p>

<p>Jim started to shake his head, but stopped,
his eyes falling before the coach’s steady look.
For the first time he realized what his trouble
was. After a moment he answered: “Maybe,
sir, a little.”</p>

<p>“That’s it then. Well, I won’t ask you what
it is that’s bothering you, Todd. It’s none of my
business. But I am going to ask you to put it
out of your mind, whatever it is, for the next fortnight.
I can use you, my boy, if you’ll let me. As
long ago as the fourth or fifth day of the season
I assigned you a distinct and important place
in the scheme of winning the Kenly game. I
didn’t take you into my confidence for a very
good reason. You had a lot to learn about the
game, about the very beginning of football, and
I didn’t want you to get it into your head that you
were a specialist and neglect the essentials. The
only kind of a specialist I want around me is the
man who knows every department of the game
and then can do one thing better than any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
else. That’s why I’ve let you go your own gait,
in a way, and that’s why I’m not telling you even
now what’s been in my mind. For that matter,
I haven’t told any one. Just now it doesn’t look
as though I’d have to, Todd. But if you can just
manage to snap out of the doldrums and get back
to where you were a week or ten days back, why,
that’ll be different. Just show me that you’re
on your toes again, keen and anxious and chock-full
of fight and I’ll show you how you can help
me and the team and the School to a victory a
week from next Saturday. Now do you think
you can do that, Todd?”</p>

<p>“I’ll try awful hard, sir,” answered Jim earnestly.
“I guess if I knew that—that it really
mattered, Mr. Cade, I could do a heap better.”</p>

<p>“Matters! Great Scott, of course it matters!
You ought to know that without being told, Todd.
The fact that you were kept on the squad when
twenty or thirty other chaps, some of whom were
showing more football than you were, were let
go should have proved to you that you were valuable;
or, anyway, that we thought you valuable.
Every man on the squad, Todd, is supposed to
do his level best, his very utmost, every minute
of every day while the season lasts. He mustn’t
expect the coach to pat him on the back or thank
him after every practice, my boy. You went bad
on us last year, you know, and I’d have had a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
good excuse for keeping you out of the squad this
fall if I’d wanted one. Now it looks as though
you were working yourself into the same attitude
of mind again, Todd. It’s all wrong, though.
When we pick a man out of sixty or seventy
others we do it not only because he shows football
ability—football ability alone never won a
game—but because we say to ourselves, ‘There’s
a man who has the right stuff in him: loyalty,
obedience, courage, determination, in short, the
qualities that win battles whether in war or in
football.’ Do you get the idea, Todd?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” Jim looked troubled. “I’m sorry,
but no one ever said it was like that. You see,
Mr. Cade, I never saw much football till last fall,
and I never knew much about—about schools and
how fellows feel about them. Maybe I ain’t making
myself clear—”</p>

<p>“I understand, my boy. Well, don’t you feel
somewhat about this school, your school, as you’ve
discovered that other chaps feel? You understand,
don’t you, why a fellow will work and
drudge and take hard knocks for two long months
with no hope of glory, no expectation of getting
into the limelight, as those fellows on the second
team are doing?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I understand that. Only—”</p>

<p>“Only what?”</p>

<p>Jim smiled apologetically. “It never seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
that anything I could do would—would make
much difference, sir. I just ain’t much of a hero,
I guess.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve got the wrong slant, Todd. Heroes
don’t all win the Croix de Guerre. A lot of
them just eat mud and never get their names on
a citation. Modesty is all right, too, Todd, but
too much of it is worse than too little sometimes.
Perhaps what you need is a little praise.” He
leaned forward and laid a hand on Jim’s knee.
“So I’ll tell you this, and you can believe every
word of it. You’re a natural-born football player,
Todd. If you were going to be here one more year
I’d turn you into as pretty a tackle as this school
ever saw; and I’m not forgetting men like Martin
Proctor, either. Even now, as inexperienced
as you are, I’d back you against a lot of the fellows
who have played your position on Alton
Field this fall. Now does that help any?”</p>

<p>Jim shook his head, supremely embarrassed.
“I don’t know, Mr. Cade. If you say so I guess
I’ve got to believe it, but, gee, I ain’t—I can’t—”</p>

<p>Mr. Cade slapped the knee under his hand and
sat back with a laugh. “Todd, you’re hopeless,”
he said. “You’ve got a bad case of ingrowing
modesty; what the psychologists call an inferiority
complex, I suppose. But never mind. You
start in to-morrow and show me that you mean
business, and about the middle of the week I’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
tell you what I want you to do to help win the
Kenly game. The best thing about it, too, is that
you can do it—if you will.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try mighty hard— Gee, that’s ten
o’clock.” At sound of the strokes Jim jumped to
his feet in dismay. “I’ll get the dickens for being
out of hall!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I can fix that. Who’s in charge of
your hall?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Tarbot.”</p>

<p>The coach rummaged about the table and finally
uncovered a writing pad. When the four lines
were finished he tore off the sheet and handed
it to Jim. “I fancy that will pacify him,” he said.</p>

<p>“Dear Mr. Tarbot: (Jim read) This is my
fault. Todd has been detained by me at my room
on a matter concerning the football team. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Inter
arma silent leges!</i> Cordially, John Cade.” Jim
grinned as he folded the paper once and thrust
it into a pocket.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” he said gratefully. “I guess
that will fix him.”</p>

<p>“I hope so. Thanks for coming over, Todd,
and— Wait just a minute. Stand where you
are, please, and put your hand up. Away up.
That’s it. Fine!” Mr. Cade stared across the
room a moment while Jim, perplexed, stood by
the door with one hand—that, as it chanced, of
which two fingers were bound with an already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
soiled white bandage—extended almost to the
ceiling. Then: “All right, Todd. Much obliged.
Good night!”</p>

<p>“Now,” Jim asked himself as he let himself out
and took long strides across Academy street, “I
wonder what that was for!”</p>

<p>Mr. Tarbot, looking as Jim thought a whole lot
like a spider awaiting the unsuspecting fly, sat
in view of the corridor as Jim entered the dormitory.</p>

<p>“Ah, Todd,” he began blandly. But Jim presented
his note before the instructor got further.
Mr. Tarbot read it, smiled faintly and laid it
aside. “A football coach who quotes Latin so
aptly, Todd, is not to be refused. Good night.”</p>

<p>“Good night, sir. Thanks.”</p>

<p>“Ah, just a moment. Was the mystery of the
stranger in the cloth cap ever fathomed, Todd?”</p>

<p>“Mystery, sir?”</p>

<p>“Ah, I see you are not in your room-mate’s
confidence, so never mind. Possibly I have been
indiscreet. Pay no heed to my maudlin mutterings,
Todd. Good night to you.”</p>

<p>“Gee,” reflected Jim as he went on upstairs,
“every one’s acting sort of crazy to-night!”</p>

<p>Clem was in bed, although he had left the light
burning for Jim, and he raised an inquiring, even
slightly anxious, face above the clothes as the latter
entered. “Did he nab you?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>Jim nodded. “Mr. Cade gave me a note for
him, though, and he didn’t say a word.”</p>

<p>Clem’s face disappeared again. “Lucky for
you,” he muttered from under the sheet. “Good
night.”</p>

</div>


<p>Returning to Number 15 Tuesday to look over his
mathematics before an eleven o’clock recitation,
Jim found Clem reading a letter from Martin
Gray. Jim knew that the letter was from Mart
because the envelope of thin, ash-hued paper,
adorned with a foreign stamp, lay face-up on the
table. Mart had written to Clem several times
since school had commenced and each letter had
reported improvement. When Clem finished the
present missive he folded it and returned it to the
envelope rather thoughtfully. Then he raised his
eyes and regarded Jim, who had taken possession
of the window-seat, for a long moment before
he finally announced: “Had a letter from
Mart.”</p>

<p>“How is he?” asked Jim.</p>

<p>“Fine, and having a wonderful time. They’re
at some place outside Florence. They’ve taken
a place called the Palazzo Something-or-Other
which Mart says is a stone morgue entirely surrounded
by flowers. He’s playing tennis a lot,
so I think he must be a good deal better.”</p>

<p>“I’m awfully glad,” said Jim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, so am I.” Clem paused in the manner
of one who has not finished, and after a moment’s
silence he added: “He writes that he thinks now
he will be able to come back to school after Christmas.”</p>

<p>Jim raised his eyes from the book he held and
looked out of the window. “Well, that’s certainly
fine news,” he commented. “Maybe he
can make up enough to graduate next spring.”</p>

<p>“He seems to think so,” agreed Clem.</p>

<p>“Well, as soon as you know for certain, Clem,
let me know and I’ll fix to get out.”</p>

<p>“No need of that. I don’t think he’d expect
you to. Don’t see how he could.”</p>

<p>“It would be only fair, though. I’d rather,
Clem.”</p>

<p>Clem flushed slightly and shrugged. “Oh, if
you feel that way,” he said stiffly. “But I dare
say he and I could get into Lykes, and so you
wouldn’t have to budge.”</p>

<p>Jim considered that placidly. “Mean I’d stay
here and get a room-mate?”</p>

<p>“Yes, or you could keep the room alone, unless
Faculty put some one in with you.”</p>

<p>“Would I have to pay for the whole room if
I was alone?”</p>

<p>“No, of course not. But I fancy they’d find
some one to dump in on you. Trust them for
that! Well, there’s nothing sure about it yet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Maybe you’ll have to put up with me for the rest
of the year.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind,” replied the other mildly.</p>

<p>Clem frowned slightly, placed Mart’s letter in
his pocket and went out, closing the door behind
him with a soft violence that to a close observer
might have suggested disapproval if not indignation.</p>

<p>At about the same time Lowell Woodruff and
Coach Cade were in consultation in the latter’s
room regarding the accommodations for the football
squad at the hotel in Lakeville. The team
and substitutes were to have luncheon at the hotel
and were to dress there before and after the
game, and the price submitted by the hotel had
brought the alarmed manager to Mr. Cade post-haste.
“Of course,” Lowell was saying sarcastically,
“the poor fish misunderstood my letter.
He’s laboring under the delusion that I asked
a price on a week’s accommodations for the whole
thirty-five.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cade chuckled. “It does sound so, doesn’t
it? But I suppose, as the letter says, prices have
risen since two years back. I’d tell him what a
small appetite you have and ask him to knock off
about fifteen dollars.”</p>

<p>Lowell grinned, but became serious again in
the instant. “Oh, well, if we had plenty of money
in the old sock, it wouldn’t matter a whole lot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
but the jolly old treasury is so low you can see
the bottom of it. And, what with fares and getting
out to the field, we’ll be closing the season
no better than even.”</p>

<p>“The field,” said Mr. Cade, “is merely a pleasant
walk from the hotel, and I don’t think it would
hurt any of the crowd to do it afoot. You can
save ten dollars or so right there.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. Some of the fellows will kick,
though. We’ve always ridden out before, you
know.”</p>

<p>“There’ll be no chance of a kick,” returned
the coach. “I’ll tell them I want them to have
the exercise. As a matter of hard fact, I think it
will do them good.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir. Then I’ll close with the old
robber. See you this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“By the way, I had a caller last night. That
fellow Todd.”</p>

<p>“Todd! Don’t tell me he’s resigned again!”</p>

<p>“No, he followed me after I left you to say
that that paper you handed me was his.”</p>

<p>“The one Squires found? Well, why didn’t
he say so when—”</p>

<p>“I asked him that and he said he was afraid
the fellows would make fun of him.”</p>

<p>“And I guess they would have. Is the play
really any good, Coach?”</p>

<p>“Tell you more in a day or two, after we’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
tried it out. It looks promising, though. I sat
up with it until after midnight and I think we’ve
got a pretty smooth-running play. By the way,
get this back to Todd, will you? There’s some
sort of a letter on the other side. Not valuable,
probably, but he may want it. He left it on the
table. I’m certain to forget it, myself.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” Lowell accepted the folded sheet
and dropped it in an inside pocket. “I’ll see him
in math class. That all? Then I’ll beat it.”</p>

<p>Jim went out for practice that afternoon determined
to make good. He had thought a great
deal about what Mr. Cade had said the evening
before and as a result the task ahead of him
seemed now vastly more important and much
more worth-while. He had taken the coach’s
praise with a generous pinch of salt, but it had
encouraged him nevertheless. To-day he showed
up a great deal better than he had at any time
since his misunderstanding with Clem, and those
who played opposite him on the second team had
their hands more than full. Both he and Sam
Tennyson were relieved before the last period of
the scrimmage game was over and sent off behind
the north stand by Mr. Cade.</p>

<p>“I want you fellows to take a ball,” said the
coach, “and practice some long passes. Start in
at about twenty yards and increase the distance
gradually. I want you, Tennyson, to get the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
overhand spiral throw down pat. You know how
it should be made. Go ahead and learn to make
it. Take plenty of time and try for accuracy and
precision first. Speed and distance can come later.
You, Todd, practice catching. I’ve seen you make
several very good catches of a passed ball. See if
you can’t do still better. Learn to take them high
and make them sure. Put in about twenty minutes
of it, but quit before that if your arms get
tired. Go ahead.”</p>

<p>Sam Tennyson, who was a tall and fairly
heavy youth with light-brown hair and a pair of
sharp dark eyes, accompanied Jim in silence after
he had obtained a ball. The full-back was a quiet
chap at best, and just now he had less to say
than usual. About all he did say as they made
their way around the empty stand was: “Something
up, Slim. Johnny’s got a hunch.”</p>

<p>Wednesday again the pair went through the
passing practice and spent nearly a half-hour
at it this time. Tennyson, who had not been called
on before for the trick, progressed more slowly
than did Jim. He got along well enough until
he tried to speed the throw. Then the ball’s flight
became erratic and Jim had to run three, four
or five yards out of position to get it. But Tennyson
had a long arm and plenty of strength
and, throwing slowly, could make the oval travel
a remarkable distance. The work went on each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
day, sometimes before scrimmage, sometimes
after. On Friday, since there was only one scrimmage
period, and the first-string players were
dismissed a half-hour earlier than usual, Mr.
Cade himself took Jim and Sam Tennyson in
charge, leaving the argument between the substitutes
and the second to Mr. Lake and Mr. Myers.
When he had watched two throws he stopped
the performance and coached Sam in holding the
ball and in spinning it as it was shot away.
“Now,” he said, “go back another five yards,
Todd. What do you make that distance?”</p>

<p>“About forty, sir.”</p>

<p>“Or forty-five. All right. Now, Tennyson,
elbow close to your side, and don’t forget to whip
your fingers under. Just think that you’re pegging
a baseball from the plate to second. It’s
the same sort of a motion: a throw from the ear,
as the catchers call it. That’s not bad, but you
went three yards at least to the left. That’s another
thing, by the way. If you must shoot to
one side of the receiver, shoot to the right—your
right, not his. But try to land the ball in his
hand.”</p>

<p>Presently he walked over and joined Jim. “I
think you’d better put your hand up and signal,”
he said. “Better get used to doing it. Don’t
signal, though, until you know that the thrower
has the ball and is looking for you. If you do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
advertise to the other team. That’s it, only
stretch your hand just as high as you can. You’ve
got a long arm, Todd, and you might as well make
use of it. Remember that the thrower has to find
his target quick. By the way, I see you’ve taken
the bandage off your fingers. Did it bother you
in catching?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, but the fingers are all right now.”</p>

<p>“Think you could catch if you had your four
fingers bandaged?”</p>

<p>Jim observed the coach doubtfully. It sounded
like a joke, but Mr. Cade’s face was quite serious.
“I don’t know, sir,” answered Jim, “but I guess
I could.”</p>

<p>“We’ll try it Monday. That’s the way. Take
them high and pull them down quick. And freeze
onto them hard, Todd. Never mind about being
too particular on the throw. I don’t believe
you’ll be on that end of it much. I want you to
specialize on catching. You see, I’ve had you in
view all the season as the man who might work
in nicely at the other end of a long pass. You
might drop around this evening after nine and
I’ll tell you how I mean to use you a week from
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Saturday’s game with Oak Grove went about as
predicted. The opponent was never dangerous,
and this year, while the visitors put up rather a
sterner defense than usual, Alton had no difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
in scoring two touchdowns in the first period
and one in the third and in keeping her own goal-line
uncrossed. In fact, Oak Grove never had the
ball inside the Gray-and-Gold’s thirty-yard line
save in the last quarter when the Alton team was
composed almost entirely of first and second
substitutes. Pep Kinsey, who acted as quarter-back
during three periods, was the individual
star for the home team, making some dazzling
run-backs of punted balls and twice scampering
around the Oak Grove end for long gains. Besides
that he ran the team smoothly and fast,
getting plays off with a celerity that more than
once found the opponents completely unprepared.
Frost made two touchdowns and Sam Tennyson
one, and Steve Whittier kicked two goals. Steve
had rather an off-day in the backfield and yielded
his place to Larry Adams when the last half began.
It was in Steve’s absence that Kinsey
missed the try-for-point after that third touchdown.
The final score was consequently 20 to 0.</p>

<p>Nothing new was shown by Alton, although
Oak Grove opened her bag of tricks wide and
tried some weird plays in an effort to score in
the fourth period. There was a good deal of punting,
with honors fairly even, and each team tried
the passing game, Alton making good four out of
seven attempts and Oak Grove succeeding five
times out of fourteen. Two of Alton’s passes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
were pulled down by Jim, and only a watchful
defense prevented him from getting away on long
runs. He showed an almost uncanny ability to
get into position unnoticed and on each occasion
that the ball was thrown to him he caught unchallenged.
Only alertness and speed on the part
of the Oak Grove backs spoiled his chances of
long gains. Jim put himself back on the football
map that afternoon and finally and conclusively
ousted Willard Sawyer from the position of right
tackle. This fact was not known to Jim then,
but he may have guessed it. Others did. Jim
was a terror on offense and as solid as a stone
wall on defense. He raced his end nip-and-tuck
down the field under punts and was into every
play it was possible for him to reach. In brief,
Jim had a big day, and if half a dozen other Alton
men hadn’t played far better than they had played
before that season he might easily have shared the
honors with Pep Kinsey. But the Gray-and-Gold
eleven had found its stride and Jim’s work was
no better than that of several others.</p>

<p>In the last period there was a brief scare when
Oak Grove, fighting valiantly and desperately
against what was almost a third-string Alton
team, hurling forward-passes of all sorts to all
directions, faking passes to hide off-tackle plays,
using criss-crosses of every conceivable variety,
worked her way to Alton’s twenty-seven yards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
where, meeting at last with denial, she was forced
to a well-nigh hopeless try-at-goal from the thirty-six
yards. The attempt failed widely and she
had shot her bolt.</p>

<p>That game added more enthusiasm at Alton,
and the mass meeting in the auditorium that evening
attained unprecedented heights of emotion.
There were speeches and songs and cheers, and
noise and confusion enough to gladden the heart
of the most irrepressible freshman. And after
the adjournment the whole affair was reënacted
with only slightly less enthusiasm in front of
Academy Hall, the evening’s program ending
with a large and certainly hilarious parade
around the campus and, finally, to Coach Cade’s
residence. Learning at last, after repeated demands
for a speech, that the coach had gone home
over Sunday, the parade disintegrated, its component
parts returning to their various domiciles
in small, but far from silent, groups.</p>

<p>On Monday the final week of preparation for
the great battle started with a hard practice for
all hands. No one was spared and no one, it
seemed, desired to be. The second earned a broad
niche in the local Hall of Fame that afternoon if
only for emerging from the two periods of fighting
without casualties. The first team had found
itself and was there to show the world!</p>

<small>CLEM DELIVERS A LETTER</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Tuesday and Wednesday rushed by. Thursday
lagged. Friday stood still, quite as though Time
had stopped doing business. Saturday—</p>

<p>Practice had been secret since the Tuesday following
the New Falmouth game. That is to say,
patriotic lower class fellows had daily, between
the hours of three and five, patrolled the outskirts
of Alton Field, warning away inquisitive townsfolk
and intrusive small boys. Since it was quite
possible to stand on Meadow street and see from
a distance the players moving about on the gridiron,
the word secret in relation to practice was
an exaggeration. Also, any resident of senior
or freshman dormitory whose window looked
westward could, had he wished, have solved the
most puzzling of the plays in which the Gray-and-Gold
team was seeking to perfect itself. However,
protracted occupancy of dormitory windows
overlooking the field was frowned upon during
the latter part of the season, and, on the whole,
Coach Cade was well enough satisfied with the
concealment allowed him and his works. Since
the same conditions had prevailed so long as football<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
had been played at Alton and no precious
secret had ever reached the enemy the coach’s
confidence seemed well founded.</p>

<p>Tuesday and Wednesday saw long sessions for
the squad, the emphasis being laid on precision
and smoothness. Tuesday evening it was rumored
that the first team had scored four times
on the scrub, and the school found new cause for
enthusiasm. Thursday witnessed a let-up in the
work. Individual instruction occupied much of
the time. Later there was a period of formation
drill, a long practice for the kickers and, finally,
a short tussle with the second team in which no
effort was made to run up the score. There was,
so report had it, much aerial football that day.
Practice was over early and some thirty youths,
unaccustomed to finding themselves foot-loose at
half-past four, wondered what to do with themselves.
Of course the usual evening sessions—“bean-tests”
the players called them—were continued
right up to and including Friday.</p>

<p>Friday was, from the football man’s point of
view, a day without rime or reason. Save that
the players reported in togs at four o’clock and
trotted around a while in signal drill, what time
the rest of the school looked on and practiced
cheers and songs, there was nothing to do and
too much time to do it. The second team made
its final appearance and staged a ten-minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
scrimmage with an eleven composed of its own
substitutes and a few first team third-stringers.
Then it performed the sacred rites incident to
disbanding, cheered and was cheered, marched in
solemn file around a pile of discarded—and incidentally
worthless—apparel and at last, followed
by the audience, still noisy, cavorted back
to the gymnasium.</p>

<p>With nothing to do save await the morrow
and what it might bring, Jim, like most of the
other players, felt suddenly let-down. Although
not of a nervous temperament, he found it extremely
difficult to sit still and even more difficult
to fix his thoughts on any one subject for more
than a half-minute at a time. Supper was hectic,
marked by sudden outbursts of laughter and
equally sudden lapses to silence. Every one made
a great pretense of hunger, but only a few of
the veterans ate normally. Coach Cade seemed
more quiet and thoughtful than usual. At Jim’s
end of the long table Lowell Woodruff, ably aided
by Billy Frost, managed to keep things enlivened,
but even so Jim was relieved when he could push
back his chair and return to Number 15. Pending
the “bean-test,” he tried to study and failed,
tried to write a letter to Webb Todd and again
failed. Perhaps had he been able to find the
letter that Webb had written to him, enclosing
the two-dollar bill, he might have obtained sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
inspiration, but that letter had mysteriously
disappeared. At seven-thirty he went around to
the gymnasium, but even Coach Cade failed him
to some extent, for the Coach had little to say
about plays and a good deal about playing and
sent them away at eight with instructions to keep
their minds off football and go to bed promptly
at ten o’clock; advice far easier to give than to
act on.</p>

<p>Jim, realizing how futile was the effort to think
of anything save football, got his rules book and
began to turn the well-thumbed leaves. If there
was anything contained therein that he didn’t
know by heart and couldn’t have recited almost
word for word he failed to find it, and he was
very glad when Clem’s hurried steps sounded in
the corridor and the door flew open before him.
Any sort of companionship, even unharmonious,
was welcome to-night.</p>

<p>Clem closed the door behind him and gave a
triumphant grunt that sounded like “<em>Huh!</em>”
Jim, looking up inquiringly, thought that his
room-mate looked awfully funny. By funny, Jim,
of course, meant strange. Still keeping what
amounted to an accusing glare on Jim, Clem advanced
in a peculiarly remorseless manner to his
side of the table, threw one leg over his chair,
lowered himself into place and folded his elbows
on the table edge. Then:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re a fine piece of cheese, aren’t you?”
he demanded.</p>

<p>There was no insult in the words as Clem said
them. On the contrary they seemed to have an
undertone of affection, and Jim was more puzzled
than ever, and found the other’s gaze increasingly
disconcerting. The fact must have shown
on his countenance, for Clem went on triumphantly:
“No wonder you look guilty, you—you
blamed old fraud!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,”
grumbled Jim, uncomfortable from the fact that
he knew he was looking guilty in spite of a clear
conscience.</p>

<p>“I’ll soon tell you,” announced Clem. “I went
over to Art’s after supper; Art Landorf, you
know. Woodie was there. When I was coming
away he asked me to give you a piece of paper.
Said Johnny Cade had given it to him a week
ago to hand to you. Something you’d left at
Johnny’s one night. I asked him what it was
and he said he didn’t know, but he pulled it out
of a mess of other truck in a pocket and handed
it to me.”</p>

<p>Jim flushed a little. “What was it?” he asked
uneasily.</p>

<p>“I guess you know what it was, you poor prune.
It was a letter from that yegg friend of yours,
Webb Todd.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh!” murmured Jim.</p>

<p>“Yes, ‘oh’!” mimicked Clem unfeelingly. “It
had some sort of a crazy cubist drawing on one
side and I naturally opened it. Of course when
I saw it was a letter I tried not to read it, but
I had to read some of it because my eyes lighted
right on it.” Clem looked so defiant as to appear
almost threatening. Jim nodded.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“You bet it’s all right!” Clem was getting
truculent. “And now I’m going to read the whole
of it, and you’re going to sit still and listen to
it!” He drew the somewhat soiled rectangular
object from his pocket and shook it challengingly
at the other.</p>

<p>“I’d rather you didn’t,” objected Jim weakly.</p>

<p>Clem’s laugh was derisive. “You go to thunder!
Anyway, I read the part that matters,
so—” He hesitated and tossed the letter across
the table. Jim picked it up without more than
a glance and buried it under a blue book. “He
says there ‘I wasn’t meaning to swipe that money,
like I told you, kid, and I’m sorry I done it. I
ain’t a thief—’ and a lot more guff. Now, then,
what about it?”</p>

<p>“Well, <em>what</em> about it?” asked Jim with returning
spirit. “I told you, but you wouldn’t believe
me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” acknowledged Clem somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
shamefacedly. “Gosh, I wanted to, Jim, but it
looked awfully fishy. And I asked Old Tarbox
if a stranger had been up here that afternoon
and he didn’t remember one. He said he might
have got by without his noticing, but it didn’t
seem to me that any one could fail to notice that
queer-looking guy! But, hang it, why didn’t you
show me that letter when you got it? Think I’ve
had a jolly time with you treating me like dirt?
Why—”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that the way you treated me?” asked
Jim, smiling faintly.</p>

<p>“No, sir, I treated you decently! Anyway, I
tried to, but you wouldn’t let me, confound you.
Didn’t you intend to show me that letter at all,
Jim?”</p>

<p>Jim shook his head.</p>

<p>“Well,” exclaimed Clem in outraged tones,
“then all I can say is that you’re the doggonedest,
meanest, false-pridest—”</p>

<p>“You’re another!” Jim was grinning now,
suddenly feeling very warm and happy, and somewhat
foolish. Clem grinned back. Then he
laughed uncertainly.</p>

<p>“You blamed old idiot!” he said affectionately.</p>

<p>Jim blinked. “Guess I was to blame, Clem,”
he said reflectively. “Maybe I’d ought to have
made you believe me; licked you until you did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
or—or something. But it didn’t seem right you
should think I was a thief, even if it did look
like I was, and so I—I got sort of uppity and—and—”</p>

<p>“Don’t blame you,” growled Clem. “Ought
to have punched my head. Wish you had. I
don’t know what made me so rotten mean. Anyhow,
I’m mighty sorry and—and I beg your pardon,
old son.”</p>

<p>“Aw, shut up,” said Jim. “Guess we both
acted loony. Let’s forget it.”</p>

<p>Clem nodded. “Hope you will. I wouldn’t
care to think that you were holding it in for
me, Jim. Funny thing is,” he went on in tones
that held embarrassment, “I don’t know whether
I got to thinking you didn’t—didn’t do it or
whether I got to not caring whether you did or
didn’t, but I’d have called quits long ago, two
or three days after, I guess, if you’d given me
a chance.”</p>

<p>“Well, as long as you were thinking me a
thief—”</p>

<p>“But I could see how most any fellow might
make a foozle like that,” interrupted Clem
eagerly. “I said that here was that fellow you’d
known and been fond of nagging you for money,
and you not having any, and there was that money
in the suit-case which you knew mighty well I’d
give you if you asked for it—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suppose you’d do it yourself?” inquired Jim
innocently.</p>

<p>“Sure! That is—” Then Clem found Jim
grinning broadly. “Well, I might. How do I
know? How does any one know what he will do
when faced by—er—by sudden temptation and all
that sort of thing?”</p>

<p>“No, you wouldn’t,” answered Jim. “Neither
would I. Webb could have starved. But, just
the same, and I think it’s sort of funny, too, I
didn’t think anything about lying! Seems like
stealing and lying aren’t much different, don’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, but, gosh, a fellow’s got to tell a
whopper sometimes to protect a friend, hasn’t
he? And that’s what you did.”</p>

<p>“I guess a lie’s a lie, just the same,” responded
Jim regretfully, “and I didn’t feel right about
telling that one to the police captain that time.
Only, I didn’t want Webb to go to jail. Gee, I
don’t know!”</p>

<p>“You needn’t have told him you gave the
money to Webb, as far as that goes. They
couldn’t have proved it on him if I hadn’t said
I’d lost it.”</p>

<p>“Gee, I never thought of that, Clem! But it
was all so sort of sudden that I didn’t have much
time to think. Lying comes mighty easy, don’t
it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, it was just like old times in Number 15
that evening. There was a lot to be said, things
that ought to have been said days and days ago
and things that had been unthought of before,
and almost before Jim knew that it was as late
as nine the ten o’clock bell rang. Even after they
were in bed the talk kept on, as:</p>

<p>“Say, Jim, it’s a shame to keep you awake,
but—”</p>

<p>“Gee, I ain’t sleepy. I’d rather talk than not.”</p>

<p>“Well, about Janus. You know we were speaking
of it a while back. You’ll join, eh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Clem. I ain’t—I’m not much
for society doings. Gee, I don’t even own a dress-suit!”</p>

<p>“You don’t need a dress-suit, you gump! I’m
going to put you through next week, and there’s
an end to it.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you want me to, all right. Father got
rid of some timberland the other day that he’s
been trying to sell for three or four years. He
didn’t get quite all he wanted, but he did pretty
well. So I guess I can afford this Janus thing.”</p>

<p>Still later: “Jim, you asleep?”</p>

<p>“Yes. What’ll you have?”</p>

<p>“Listen. About Mart coming back—”</p>

<p>“I know. That’s all right.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean, all right?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, you fellows can have this room or I’ll
find some one else to come in here. Just as long
as I don’t have to pay the whole rent—”</p>

<p>“You make me sick! I never had any notion
of going in with Mart. He doesn’t expect me
to. I just said that because you made me mad,
you silly ass!”</p>

<p>“Oh! Well, I didn’t—understand. Still, you
mustn’t feel like you’ve got to turn Mart down,
Clem.”</p>

<p>“I don’t. I’m not turning him down because
he hasn’t even suggested it. If you can’t talk
sense you’d better go to sleep.”</p>

<p>“All right,” chuckled Jim. “Good night.”</p>

<p>Some time later Clem awoke in the darkness to
find groans and heart-breaking gasps coming from
Jim’s bed. After a moment of sleepy concern
Clem went across and shook his chum into consciousness.
“Hey, wake up! What’s the matter,
old son? Got the nightmare?”</p>

<p>“Gee!” muttered Jim. “That you, Clem?
Was I making a row?”</p>

<p>“Were you! Well, rather! What—”</p>

<p>“Gee, it was awful! Sam threw the ball to
me and I was all set for it when the crazy thing
began running around my head in circles and
making a noise like—like an automobile and I
couldn’t catch it! Every time I’d make a grab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
it would dodge out of the way! And about a
hundred fellows with big white mittens on stood
and laughed at me. Gee, it was fierce!”</p>

<p>“White mittens?” chuckled Clem. “Well, you
did have the Willies for fair! Calm yourself, old
son, and nuzzle down again. It must be mighty
close to daylight.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>ALTON VS. KENLY HALL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The players trundled away from school that Saturday
morning at ten o’clock, cheered to the echo
by some three hundred and fifty football-mad adherents.
The rest of the student body left on
the twelve-eight train, to which an extra day-coach
had been added. Clem, sharing a seat with
Landorf and Imbrie—Imbrie sat on the arm—beguiled
the first part of the journey with the
morning papers. Both the Alton paper and that
published in the near-by city gave a flattering
amount of space to the Alton-Kenly Hall game.
Not unnaturally, the home journal predicted a
victory for the Gray-and-Gold. The other favored
Kenly. Some writer signing himself
“Sporticus” told his city readers that he had
seen both Alton and Kenly Hall in action and
that it would take a much better prophet than
he pretended to be to pick certainly the winner
of to-day’s contest.</p>

<p>“Alton,” he continued, “has a fine-looking
team that is well grounded in the rudiments, plays
with unusual speed and has been developed steadily
since the first of the season with the single
purpose of reaching the apex of its power at two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
o’clock this afternoon. Starting with a practically
green team, Coach ‘Johnny’ Cade has built around
a nucleus of four veterans an aggregation that
has shown a lot of football gumption and a good
deal of strength during the last three games.
The Gray-and-Gold looks to be better on attack
than on defense, but the last week may have
brought about an improvement in the latter department,
and her line may prove strong enough
to stop the efforts of the Kenly backs. If it can
Alton will stand a good chance to cop the contest,
for I like her attack. Rumor credits her
with having developed a nice bunch of running
and passing plays that have not, so far, been
shown. Whether she has anything that will prevail
against a defense as experienced and steady
as Kenly’s, only developments can prove. Alton’s
center-trio is quite as good as Kenly’s. Cheswick,
at center, combines weight with speed and
has shown himself a master at diagnosing the
opponent’s plays. Captain Gus Fingal, right
guard, is playing an even better game than last
season when he was a large, sharp thorn in the
side of the enemy. Powers, the other guard, lacks
Fingal’s weight but is remarkably steady. He
also has speed. Speed, in fact, is the outstanding
feature of the Gray-and-Gold line from end
to end. At tackles Alton will play Roice and
either Sawyer or Todd. Sawyer has seen more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
service, but Todd has been coming fast for the
last fortnight and, in spite of lack of weight, looks
to have the call for the right side position. Levering
and Borden, ends, have not shown anything
spectacular so far except an ability to move fast,
and they sure do that. In the backfield Alton
will start ‘Pep’ Kinsey at quarter. Kinsey
doesn’t look like a quarter-back, but he has held
down the job satisfactorily most of the season
and seems to get more out of his team than his
alternate, Latham. Whittier and Frost are two
good half-backs who will have quite a lot to say
for themselves. Whittier is rather more of the
defensive back than ‘Billy’ Frost, but he, too, is
capable of gaining if given the ball. Frost is
the lad for Kenly to keep an eye on, for he can
hit the line like a five-ton truck and is a wonder
at running. He will also be on the receiving
end of some of the forward heaves that Alton
is expected to pull off. The remaining back, Tennyson,
is something of an unknown quantity, since
he took the place of Crumb late in the season
when the latter was injured.”</p>

<p>“Sporticus” gave an equal amount of space
in his column to an appraisal of the individual
members of the Kenly team and then summed
up as follows: “On season’s performance, then,
Kenly ought to win to-day’s fracas by two scores,
but no football solon pins his faith utterly on
performance. So when I predict a verdict for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the Cherry-and-Black I have in mind one important
fact that has been fully established, which
is: The team with the power wins. Kenly has
the power. She lacks the speed of her opponent
and uses fewer plays. But she has a line that
has proved practically shot-proof, and her attack,
while not varied, has a relentless quality that
makes it a ground-gainer. Of course, surprises
may happen and upset the dope. Some of those
trick plays that Alton is believed to have in her
duffle-bag may catch Kenly napping. A forward-pass
thrown at the right moment may land over
the goal-line. But every student of the gentle
Art of Football knows that where one game is
won by forward-passes or trick runs nine are
won by the plain, old-fashioned, garden-variety
of football. That’s why I select Kenly; reserving
an alibi, though, as set forth above.”</p>

<p>“Humph,” said Clem, when he had finished
the article, “these newspaper sport writers are
great guys to play it safe. This fellow just knows
that Kenly is going to win—<em>if</em>! You’d think
from the way he goes on that Kenly’s line hadn’t
been shot more than once already. ‘Invulnerable’
he calls it. What about Lorimer? I suppose
she didn’t get a touchdown against Kenly!
And look at last Saturday’s game. Emmons
scored twice, once by a pass from the ten-yard
line and once from the field. If she found Kenly’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
line invulnerable how the heck did she get within
scoring distance? ‘Sporticus’ has his signals
crossed!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be hard on the poor chaps,” said Imbrie.
“They have to fill their columns somehow,
old dear.”</p>

<p>“‘Somehow’ is right,” grumbled Clem.</p>

<p>At two o’clock, when Alton kicked off to Kenly,
the sun was shining brightly and a slight breeze
was quartering the field, lending some advantage
to the visiting team. The air held quite a nip,
and coat collars were generally worn turned up.
From the player’s standpoint it was ideal weather,
from the spectator’s it was a bit unpleasant on
hands and feet. The cheering, which had been
fairly incessant for the past ten minutes, ceased
as Captain Gus stepped forward and booted the
new brown oval high and far.</p>

<p>The Kenly quarter fumbled, but a half-back
rescued the ball on his seventeen yards and ran
it back to the twenty. Kenly tested Cheswick
and got one yard. Then she punted to Alton’s
thirty-three, the ball going outside. Frost got
two through the center and Tennyson slid off
right tackle for three more. Whittier punted to
the opponent’s twenty-seven and Levering missed
a tackle, the catcher advancing seven yards before
he was spilled by Powers. Two tries at
the Alton line netted but five yards and a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
pass over the center grounded. Kenly kicked
beautifully against the breeze, the ball falling on
Alton’s seventeen, where Kinsey was thrown
hard. Time was called for Alton. Frost got two
through the right of the enemy’s line when play
was resumed and followed it with six more on
an off-tackle run. Whittier tried a run around
the left and was stopped for a loss of a yard.
Whittier punted, but Kenly was off-side and it
was Alton’s ball on her twenty-nine. Whittier
circled left end on first down and gained two
yards and Tennyson gathered in one more by a
plunge at center. Whittier punted to Kenly’s
twenty-six and the Cherry-and-Black quarter ran
the ball back to the forty before he was stopped
by Levering.</p>

<p>Kenly got started then and punched the enemy
line for short gains, making it first down on Alton’s
forty-eight. Then the Kenly full-back managed
to get free on a wide run and landed the
pigskin on the visitor’s thirty-six, following this
with a fierce plunge at Powers that gave him three
more. On the next play Roice was off-side and
Kenly advanced to Alton’s twenty-eight. She
made it first down on Alton’s twenty-five-yard
line. A plunge at the left of the visitor’s line
was stopped and a short pass grounded. On a
fake-kick play Kenly’s big full-back gained three
off Todd, at right tackle. Kenly’s drop-kicker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
retired to the thirty-yard line and, since the ball
was directly in front of goal, a score seemed imminent.
But the pass from center was short and
before the kicker could get the ball away the
Alton forwards were through on top of him and
the kick was blocked.</p>

<p>Kenly’s left tackle recovered the rolling ball
on his thirty-eight, beating Whittier to it by inches
only, and, after she had failed to gain through
Powers, Kenly grounded a pass. A second pass
was intercepted by Frost.</p>

<p>Alton tried to knife Kinsey through but lost
a yard, and Tennyson’s slide off tackle regained
the loss and no more. Then Frost slipped off
right tackle for a run of seventeen yards, being
finally forced out on his forty-four. A cross-buck,
with Borden carrying, gained four, Tennyson got
two through right guard and Whittier skirted the
left end for six more, making it first down on
the enemy’s forty-four. After three wasted efforts,
Whittier punted over Kenly’s goal-line, and
the ball came back to the twenty. Two attempts
at the line failed and Kenly punted on third down
to mid-field. An off-side play gave Alton five
yards and in two downs she added four more.
Whittier punted to Kenly’s eleven and the Cherry-and-Black
left half was downed in his tracks by
Todd. Kenly lost four yards on an end run,
made two off left tackle and two more through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
center and then punted to her own forty-one.
Frost was thrown for a loss on an end run and
the quarter ended with the ball in Alton’s possession
on the enemy’s forty-three yards.</p>

<p>So far it was still anybody’s game and even
the clever “Sporticus,” whose narrative of the
first period I have quoted almost verbatim, after
seeing Kenly’s line pierced more than once, would
have hesitated about making another prediction.
Neither team had shown the ability to gain
through the other’s line consistently. Although
outweighted, the Alton forwards had held their
own very well against the enemy, usually getting
the jump on their slower opponents with good
effect. The hard-hitting Kenly backs had found
the going more difficult than had been prophesied,
while the Alton backs, starting quickly from their
positions well behind their line, had already
proved the value of the new formation. Whittier’s
punts from close behind center had not
surprised Kenly greatly, since her scouts had prepared
her for them, but the fact that she was
always more or less uncertain when they were
coming did worry her far more than appeared.</p>

<p>The second period started without changes in
either line-up: for Alton it was still Levering,
Roice, Powers, Cheswick, Fingal, Todd, Borden,
Kinsey, Whittier, Frost and Tennyson. Coach
Cade had put his best foot forward and meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
to keep it there as long as he could. With the
wind slightly in her favor, Kenly punted frequently
in the second quarter, trusting to get a
break that would put her within scoring distance.
Alton kicked only when all other means had failed.
She managed to keep her territory fairly free of
the enemy through most of the period, but in the
final five minutes Kenly worked an invasion.
Punting from her thirty-two yards, the Cherry-and-Black
landed the pigskin in Pep Kinsey’s
arms near his twenty-yard line. The kick was
long and fairly high, the wind floating the ball
along for an added ten yards, and Pep misjudged
and at the last moment had to run back. Frost,
playing back with him, saw the ball in jeopardy
and raced across for it with the result that the
pigskin was almost lost to both of them. Pep
managed to hold it after a moment’s juggling,
however, but by that time a frantic Kenly end
was on him and he was tackled fiercely, Frost
being out of position to offer protection. Pep
stayed flat and time was called. After working
over the Alton quarter for a while, Jake signaled
and Horace Latham, already warming up before
the bench, ran on. Pep was led off looking pretty
groggy.</p>

<p>Two attacks on tackles failed to get the ball
much farther out of the dangerous neighborhood
and Latham punted. The kick was poor and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
ball went out at Alton’s forty-yard line. Then
it was that Kenly showed her power, for she
marched back to the eighteen yards without a
pause, making her distance the first time by two
inches and gaining her final stand by a short toss
across the Alton left wing that gave her a needed
four yards. Then, however, Alton stood firm.
Walzer had been sent in for Hick Powers, who
had been pretty roughly used, and Kenly’s two
attempts on the left of the enemy’s center were
piled up for no gain. Another of the Kenly short
passes grounded and once more her drop-kicker
stepped into the limelight. This time the Cherry-and-Black
line was a stone wall, the ball was
passed neatly and the kicker had plenty of leisure
to perform his trick. The ball thudded away from
his foot and climbed into the air, far beyond the
upraised tips of eager fingers, passing squarely
between the uprights and high over the cross-bar.
Kenly had drawn first blood and the vacant space
beside her name on the scoreboard suddenly held
a large white 3!</p>

<p>That was just about all there was to that second
quarter. Jim was taken out in favor of
Sawyer just before the end of it. Alton fought
into the enemy’s territory in the last minute of
play only to yield the pigskin on a punt, and before
the teams could line up again the whistle
blew.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>THE BANDAGED HAND</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Back in the gymnasium, in a small room provided
for its use, the Alton team spent eleven tense
minutes. Coaches, trainer and rubbers toiled
without let-up. Faults were pointed out by stern-faced
assistants and offenders were taken severely
to task. Johnny Cade, one forefinger tapping
Latham’s chest, spoke quietly but earnestly. The
pungent odor of rubbing liniment filled the air.
Jake moved briskly and cheerfully about, unwinding
bandage and tape and clipping with his little
blunt-nosed scissors. And finally Manager Woodruff
took his eyes from the dial of his watch and
called: “Four minutes!”</p>

<p>On the field Kenly sang and cheered, and Alton,
although outnumbered, was scarcely less vociferous.
The big cherry-red flag stood out above
the home stand, snapping briskly in the increasing
wind. Chilled feet were coaxed back to
warmth and coats more closely buttoned. The
sunlight had lost its heat now and the breeze was
taking on an icier tang. The minutes passed
slowly, but at last the Kenly stand sprang to its
feet with an “Aye-e-e!” as the red-stockinged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
warriors came into view again. Then the cheer
leaders waved and the long Kenly cheer swept
across the field. Ere it had ended the Alton side
was vocal, too, for a tall, light-haired youth, gray-armed
and gray-legged, trotted into sight. Behind
him trailed twenty-nine others of his kind,
and then a little squad of non-combatants. A
white-sweatered man moved into the field, a gray-sweatered
man joined him. The cheers continued
deafeningly. Linesmen, blowing on chilled hands,
dragged their long rods down near the thirty-yard
line. Alton had to yield the advantage of
the wind this time, but had elected to receive the
kick-off.</p>

<p>Three changes in the Kenly team were seen,
two in the line and one in the backfield. For
Alton, Latham remained at quarter, Sawyer at
right tackle and Walzer at left guard. With the
wind behind it, the ball sailed almost to the five-yard
line before it dropped, and Alton let it go
over. Back on her twenty, the Gray-and-Gold
flashed into life. It seemed that she was showing
her true strength for the first time. Straight
down the field she marched, overwhelming Kenly
with the speed of her attack, mingling straight
line-jabs, swift dashes around the tackles and
short side passes that led to wide runs. Every
shot found its mark and not once was Alton halted
until, almost on Kenly’s thirty, a wide run went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
agley and Billy Frost was thrown behind his line
for a five-yard loss.</p>

<p>A short pass across the left of the line was
caught by Latham, but the gain was less than the
previous loss. Once more, Tennyson heaved the
ball, this time far toward the side-line, but it
was knocked down. Kenly’s hoarse reiterated appeal
of “<em>Hold ’em, Kenly! Hold ’em, Kenly!</em>”
was being answered. It was fourth down now
and there was still five yards to gain, with the
ball on Kenly’s thirty-one yards. A goal from
the field seemed a hopeless thought, yet that is
what Latham called for. Captain Gus was summoned
back and Latham dropped to a knee in
front of him close to the forty-yard line. Shouts
of “<em>Block it! Block it!</em>” swept across from the
home stand. Cheswick sped the ball back, Latham
caught it and placed it and Gus stepped forward.
The lines heaved and bent. But foot met ball
and the pigskin shot forward. Latham had canted
it, as he hoped, so that it would fly low, but after
it had cleared the frantic arms of the oncoming
enemy it was caught by a sudden gust and changed
its flight. For an instant it seemed to pause.
Then it went up and up, hung for a breathless
moment high in air and began its descent. Already
Kenly was howling its relief, for the ball
was coming down well short of the bar.</p>

<p>It descended close to the five-yard line and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
was a red-legged tackle who caught it to him and
sprang forward. But Sam Tennyson wrapped
his long arms about his neck and pulled him back
and down. It was Kenly’s ball on her three yards.</p>

<p>The Kenly kicker stepped back well behind his
goal-line and a little to the left of center, mindful
of the nearer post looming dangerously close,
and the silence of suspense fell. Alton’s “<em>Block
that kick! Block that kick!</em>” dwindled to a faint,
hoarse mutter. Back went the ball, but low, and
the kicker had to step forward to get it. Recovering,
he saw the left of his line torn apart
as Alton burst through. There was no time now
for a punt. Tucking the ball under his arm, he
started away to the right, seeking to pass behind
the goal and find a safe path out of his dilemma.
And for a second success seemed to await him.
But just as he swung back toward the field, Jake
Borden swept down on him. Jake missed his
tackle, but he stopped the runner long enough for
Roice to reach him and the two went down together
a yard behind the goal-line.</p>

<p>Alton roared in triumph and a figure 2 went
up for the visitors. It was not much of a score,
but it was something, and the faint-hearted among
the Alton adherents were jubilant. At least, the
Gray-and-Gold had not been shut-out! The ball
went out to the thirty yards and play began once
more. Kenly twice failed to advance a runner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
and then kicked. Latham caught and was downed
instantly. Alton began another march, but it
ended at her own forty-yard line and there Latham
punted short to the enemy’s thirty-eight. Kenly
sprang a long forward-pass that almost but not
quite succeeded. A shorter attempt went for six
yards and two slams at the line gave her first
down on the fifty-yard line. Then followed
Kenly’s moment of power, for she plunged and
battered her way forward for two first downs and
placed the ball on Alton’s twenty-eight. Walzer
was hurt and Hick Powers went back to left guard
position. Kenly tried a full-back run that would
have netted her twelve yards had not an end been
off-side. As it was, she was set back to the thirty-three,
and two plunges were stopped and a third
down gained but three yards off left tackle.
Kenly set herself as for a try at a field goal but,
instead, hurled a long pass diagonally toward the
right corner of the field. The wind both aided
and hindered that throw. It added distance but
it also swept the ball away from the waiting end
and into the outstretched hands of Sam Tennyson.
Sam dodged and wriggled and fought back to the
seventeen before force of numbers laid him low.</p>

<p>Presently Latham again punted and, although
the kick failed of distance, the Kenly back who
caught was dropped the instant the pigskin was
in his hands. From Alton’s forty-six yards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Kenly began another advance. This time she
reached only the thirty-two yards, where, with
three downs gone, she decided to take what was
offered her. Her kicker was squarely on the
forty-yard line when he booted, and this time the
Kenly line held fast. But the ball, while it had
both height and distance, passed outside the left-hand
upright; although it was not until a moment
had passed and the figure 3 on the scoreboard was
not changed that the spectators knew whether or
not the goal had been kicked. Then Alton voiced
her relief in hearty fashion. Two more plays laid
the pigskin on Alton’s twenty-four yards and the
whistle blew for the last intermission.</p>

<p>Three to two and still anybody’s game!</p>

<p>That either team would be able to put over a
touchdown looked improbable. One or the other
might win in the last quarter by a field-goal, but
it seemed a safe wager that neither Gray-and-Gold
nor Cherry-and-Black had enough strength
to cross her opponent’s goal-line. Both in attack
and defense the rivals had shown themselves well
matched. What Kenly possessed of superiority
in weight was offset by Alton’s speed, while Alton’s
speed was not a sufficient asset to win her
passage over the last five lines. But with the
favoring wind behind her now Alton might,
thought the more hopeful of the visitors, bring
some trick into play that would decide the contest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
in her favor. Among the hopeful was Clem,
shivering between Imbrie and Landorf, high on
the Alton stand. Clem’s shivers were due more
to excitement than cold, however, and that excitement
was heightened when, as the teams gathered
again, two forms ran on from the visitors’
side-line. One was Pep Kinsey. The other was
Jim Todd. Clem arose to his feet and shouted
madly.</p>

<p>“<em>Atta boy, Jim! Atta boy! Atta boy!
Atta—</em>”</p>

<p>Landorf pulled him down to his seat. Those
around laughed and cheered him. Then the leaders
called for short cheers for Latham and Sawyer,
and then for Kinsey and Todd. Clem was
babbling incoherently and not until the cheers
were over did Landorf sense what he was saying.</p>

<p>“That’s why Johnny took him out in the third,”
Clem was exclaiming. “Must have hurt his hand
pretty badly.”</p>

<p>“Who hurt his hand?” asked Art.</p>

<p>“Jim. Look at it. Wait till he turns—there!
His left hand is all bandaged up!”</p>

<p>It certainly was. Against the soiled khaki of
his pants his left hand shone like an Easter lily
against dark foliage. The four fingers were
bound separately with clean white gauze and
looked oddly conspicuous, Landorf thought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
“Funny he managed to get ’em all hurt,” he said.
“That’s what I call hogging it!”</p>

<p>A whistle blew and Pep Kinsey’s voice piped
out sharply. Whittier took the ball as it sped
back from center and dashed toward the left.
Kinsey caught it at a short pass and sped along
the line to the right. Jim had a hole there. Tennyson
went through, clearing it out and crashing
against a Kenly back, and Pep followed. Three
yards gain. Fourth down and three to go. Again
the ball went to Whittier and with two short
strides toward his line he punted high. Down
went the ends and down went Jim, racing them
to the enemy’s eighteen. Above them sailed the
ball, turning lazily over and over. A Kenly back
edged forward, paused, turned and raced backward.
He caught on his eighteen yards and it
was Jim who closed his arms about his thighs,
lifted him back and deposited him on his sixteen.
A hard-hearted referee put the ball on the eighteen,
waved a hand and slipped out of the way.
Kenly started toward the Alton goal once more.</p>

<p>Failing, at last, near mid-field to gain at the
line, she passed across the center and made eight.
But a moment later she was again forced to kick.
Frost pulled the ball down on his twenty-two, side-stepped
a Kenly end, whirled from the grasp of
a Kenly tackle and went plunging in and out until
the enemy closed in about him on the thirty-six.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
An off-side penalty put Alton back to the thirty-one,
and two plays later Whittier again punted,
from his thirty-five. Once more the Kenly back
was thrown in his tracks and once more Kenly
set her face toward the distant goal. Then came
a punt from her thirty-nine that went almost
straight in air and dropped out-of-bounds at Alton’s
forty-three.</p>

<p>Ever since the beginning of the quarter Jim
had been listening for a certain signal and now
it came. “Formation L!” called the quarter.
Jake Borden swung out and trotted to the left
of the line, taking position between Roice and Levering.
“Signals! Fifteen, thirty-seven, twelve!
Fifteen, thirty-seven—”</p>

<p>The ball went back and Alton flew into action.
It was the signal Jim had been awaiting, yet it
was not the play, for although Sam had started
before the ball and raced off and backward to the
left, and although Whittier, with ball poised high,
was following him slowly, stepping back warily
and apparently searching for an uncovered receiver,
Jim knew that Play 37 was to go for a
run the first time it was called. So, instead of
wandering away to the right and trying to look
as if he was searching for four-leaf clovers or
had lost his pocket-knife and was trying to find
it, Jim threw himself into the opposing tackle,
twisted past and slammed around behind the opposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
line. Whittier turned and tossed to Tennyson
and Sam sprang forward. Kinsey laid low
the Kenly right half and Sam was going hard
when he gained the line, well outside, but the entire
Kenly backfield had been drawn to its right,
and so had every other member of the team, and
the best Tennyson could do was fight his way to
the forty-seven for a four-yard gain. But the
play had proved itself. Kenly had first suspected
a forward-pass and guarded against it, her backs
spreading and waiting. Then, when Whittier had
made the on-side toss to Tennyson, she had concluded
that it meant a run and had moved, almost
as one man, across to meet it. And now
Jim waited eagerly to hear the “37” again.</p>

<p>But it didn’t come. Alton made her way to
the enemy’s thirty-seven only to lose the ball when
Frost fumbled when tackled. A few minutes later
she was back on her own thirty-five, the ball in
her possession after a Kenly punt. Kenly was
now satisfied, it seemed, to play for time and trust
to fortune to bring her another scoring opportunity.
If that failed her, she was still certain
of victory if she could keep Alton from adding
to that insufficient 2. Twice she punted out of
danger and back into Alton territory. Alton was
using every play she knew now, but Kenly was
resisting desperately. New men were running on
for her and old and wearied ones were stumbling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
off. Alton, too, made changes, though fewer.
Tate and Kruger went in at the ends of the line
and Cheswick, thoroughly played out, gave place
to Benning. The end was drawing nigh. Seven
minutes became six and six minutes dwindled to
five.</p>

<p>It was Alton’s ball again, following a punt, on
her thirty-four. Tennyson made four outside
tackles on a delayed buck, Whittier gained three
straight ahead between center and right guard
and Frost made it first down on a slide off left
tackle. Tennyson passed to Whittier and the latter
scampered around the short end for seven
more and put the ball over the center line. Frost
lost two, got three and made it first down again.
So it went, Kenly fighting but yielding. On the
enemy’s thirty-eight, on fourth down, Whittier
faked a kick and tossed to Frost and Frost ran
to the left and got his distance on a wide run
behind fine interference. The ball was close to
the left side-line now and on the next play Whittier
shot off to the right on a wide sweep that
gained only a yard. And then Jim, achingly impatient,
heard what he had been longing to hear
once more.</p>

<p>“Formation L!”</p>

<p>“Seventeen, thirty-seven, eleven! Seventeen—”</p>

<p>Tennyson was off, running hard, to the left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>“—Thirty-seven!”</p>

<p>Jim engaged the opposing end, blocked him for
an instant and then let him through inside. Kenly
was crying “Watch a pass!” and “Fake!” and
“End run on right!” Jim ambled around his end,
the enemy moving before him. The Kenly defensive
back was edging to his right, well down
the field. Jim swung aside and sped toward the
side of the field. Then, turning, he faced the confusion
he had left behind. He was alone and
unnoted as yet. Up went his long left arm and
the four white-bandaged fingers made a startling
beacon against the dark hues of the stand behind
him. Whittier had tossed to Sam and Sam
was peering across the confusion of leaping,
struggling forms. They were closing in on him
fast. A Kenly lineman had trickled through and
Whittier met him square and sent him reeling
aside. But the whole Cherry-and-Black team was
bearing down now and Sam, scorning further subterfuge,
raised the ball in his right hand, faced
the distant white signal, drew his arm back and
threw!</p>

<p>Then he was out of sight behind leaping figures,
and Jim, his gaze on the speeding ball, knew that
the tide had set back his way. Forms sensed
rather than seen grew larger and larger as they
raced toward him. Frantic cries of warning and
shouts of alarm came to him. He had himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
ready now, though, and the ball, sent low and
hard and straight, was shooting at him, a brown
missile that grew ever larger. Then he met it
with his hands, gave one step to ease the catch,
tucked the ball under his right hand and sped
away.</p>

<p>He had been just over Kenly’s forty-yard line
when he had caught, and some twelve yards from
the side-line. When he had put one more white
streak underfoot he turned to the left, the nearer
upright of the goal his destination. But that
course was not to be held long. Already a fleet-footed
Kenly quarter-back was speeding to meet
him, while steps pounded hard behind and to the
right. Jim eased away toward the side-line and
pushed the thirty-yard mark behind him. Then
the quarter was on him, coming straight from
the side. Jim thought quick, dug one heel and
spun to the left. A hand slapped at his thigh
and a red-clad arm swept upward, but the quarter
fell past, clutching vainly, and Jim Todd went on,
friend and foe racing and falling behind him, on
past the twenty yards and the fifteen and to the
ten. There the enemy made its last appeal to
Fortune. A Kenly end hurled himself forward
and his fingers seized about Jim’s left leg. <a href="#image04">Jim</a>
faltered, then went on a stride, <a href="#image04">dropped to a knee,
struggled erect again and again advanced</a>. A
stride—another— Figures were all about him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
now and suddenly he could go no farther. He
plunged forward, face-down, the ball, firmly
grasped, held at arms’ length. A ton of weight
fell on him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 393px;">
<a id="image04">
  <img src="images/image04.jpg" width="393" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_289">Jim dropped to a knee, struggled erect again and
again advanced.</a></div>
</div>

<p>Some one was tugging at the ball, but Jim held
it in a death grip. A voice was calling: “Get up!
Get up!” Then a white sweater sleeve came into
his vision and his fingers released their hold.
The weight was gone and arms were pulling him
to his feet. He stood erect, breathless, anxious,
and looked about. Gus Fingal was grinning as
well as a cut and swollen lip would allow. So
was Hick Powers. The rest of his team were
gathering along the five-yard line and Kenly,
suddenly strangely weary and discouraged-looking,
was assembling between them and the goal.
Then Jim understood. His own grin answered
the others.</p>

<p>“Gee, I guess it was over, wasn’t it?” he panted.</p>

<p>“Two feet over,” said Captain Gus. “Come
on and let’s finish it up, Slim. Only forty seconds
more!”</p>

<p>Slim went back to his place, the lines heaved,
a thud followed and again wild, triumphant cheers
burst from the Alton stand. On the scoreboard
an 8 was changed to a 9.</p>

<p>Half a minute later, having joined in a hoarse
cheer for the defeated rival, Slim fought his way
toward the bench. But there wasn’t much fight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
left now and he was soon captured. From the
shoulders of two shouting, maniacal schoolmates
he looked down over a sea of bobbing heads. <a href="#image01">He
felt rather tired, very happy and—extremely foolish!</a></p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given

not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
